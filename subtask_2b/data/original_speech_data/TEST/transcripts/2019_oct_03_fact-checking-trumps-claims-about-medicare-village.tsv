0001	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much.
0002	Donald Trump	Special place.
0003	Donald Trump	Really special place.
0004	Donald Trump	But where I'm disappointed: I said, "We could have had 25,000 people if we did it outside."
0005	Donald Trump	They said -- Did you see all the people outside?
0006	Donald Trump	They all want your seat.
0007	Donald Trump	That's the way life goes.
0008	Donald Trump	And you're not giving it up.
0009	Donald Trump	I know you too well.
0010	Donald Trump	You're not going to give it up.
0011	Donald Trump	Please sit down.
0012	Donald Trump	Let's enjoy it.
0013	Donald Trump	Let's enjoy ourselves.
0014	Donald Trump	[Audience member calls "We love you, President Trump"]
0015	Donald Trump	No, you got tremendous crowds out there -- thank you.
0016	Donald Trump	I love your leg.
0017	Donald Trump	Look at that, he has my name tattooed on his leg.
0018	Donald Trump	How did you get to The Villages?
0019	Donald Trump	How do you get to The Villages?
0020	Donald Trump	Huh?
0021	Donald Trump	That's great.
0022	Donald Trump	But I'm thrilled to be here in one of the most famous and thriving communities anywhere in Florida, and really anywhere in the world, as far as I'm concerned -- The Villages.
0023	Donald Trump	In fact, I was thinking about moving to The Villages, but I just couldn't leave Mar-a-Lago.
0024	Donald Trump	I couldn't leave it.
0025	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I got stuck at Mar-a-Lago.
0026	Donald Trump	I don't know.
0027	Donald Trump	But this has been a great area for us, and it's been a great part of our victory.
0028	Donald Trump	I don't know if we got 100 percent, Ron, but it was pretty close, right?
0029	Donald Trump	Anybody in there didn't vote for us, right?
0030	Donald Trump	No, we love it.
0031	Donald Trump	And we met the folks that built The Villages and that run The Villages, and they're out here someplace.
0032	Donald Trump	And they've done a fantastic job.
0033	Donald Trump	Where are they?
0034	Donald Trump	Where -- they're here some place.
0035	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.
0036	Donald Trump	What a job you've done.
0037	Donald Trump	Great job.
0038	Donald Trump	Great job.
0039	Donald Trump	And that was started with your grandfather and your father and you folks.
0040	Donald Trump	And what a great job you've done.
0041	Donald Trump	You know, in my old days, I would have been jealous.
0042	Donald Trump	Now I couldn't care less about them.
0043	Donald Trump	[Laughter] It's amazing.
0044	Donald Trump	It's amazing how being President can do that to you.
0045	Donald Trump	[Laughter] So in my campaign for President, I made you a sacred pledge that I would strengthen, protect, and defend Medicare for all of our senior citizens.
0046	Donald Trump	And you see it's under siege, but it's not going to happen.
0047	Donald Trump	Today, I will sign a very historic executive order that does exactly that: We are making your Medicare even better, and we are not letting anyone -- it will never be taken away from you.
0048	Donald Trump	We're not letting anyone get close.
0049	Donald Trump	You see these people on the other side?
0050	Donald Trump	These people are crazy, by the way.
0051	Donald Trump	They're totally crazy.
0052	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But they want to take it away and give you lousy healthcare.
0053	Donald Trump	It's pretty incredible.
0054	Donald Trump	You want to keep your doctors, right?
0055	Donald Trump	Remember, with Obama -- President Obama, right?
0056	Donald Trump	He said, "You can keep your doctor.
0057	Donald Trump	You can keep your plan."
0058	Donald Trump	That didn't work out too well for the people.
0059	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos, Audience member calls "We're trying to forget"]
0060	Donald Trump	Twenty-eight times.
0061	Donald Trump	He said he's trying to forget.
0062	Donald Trump	[Laughter] You better never forget, okay?
0063	Donald Trump	Never forget.
0064	Donald Trump	As long as I'm President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits.
0065	Donald Trump	And that's what we're here to do today.
0066	Donald Trump	This order is the latest step in my administration's drive to ensure the world's best healthcare for all Americans.
0067	Donald Trump	Together, we're creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve.
0068	Donald Trump	And that's what we're doing -- we're strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.
0069	Donald Trump	Our economy is booming.
0070	Donald Trump	We're doing fantastically well.
0071	Donald Trump	I think it gets a little bit hurt by politics.
0072	Donald Trump	But our country is so strong and our economy is so powerful that even politics, and even when you have the -- the "Do-Nothings" -- I call them the -- really, the "Do-Nothing Dems."
0073	Donald Trump	They can't even affect it very much.
0074	Donald Trump	We've created over 6 million new jobs since the election.
0075	Donald Trump	The unemployment rate has reached a 51-year low.
0076	Donald Trump	Two point -- think of that.
0077	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0078	Donald Trump	Then, soon, it's going to be a historic number, like so many of the other numbers.
0079	Donald Trump	2.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty.
0080	Donald Trump	That means more Americans that now have -- and that's what it's all about -- they have a great way of life.
0081	Donald Trump	They have affordable healthcare options and millions of seniors are enjoying better, healthier, and more prosperous retirements.
0082	Donald Trump	I should be retiring with you.
0083	Donald Trump	I should be in this audience, clapping.
0084	Donald Trump	But I didn't trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have.
0085	Donald Trump	[Audience chants "Four More Years"]
0086	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0087	Donald Trump	It's true.
0088	Donald Trump	I didn't trust anybody.
0089	Donald Trump	It's very important.
0090	Donald Trump	And nobody has done more in two and a half years -- their first two and a half years -- than what we've done.
0091	Donald Trump	Whether it's Right to Try, whether it's tax cuts -- no matter what it is, nobody has done we've done.
0092	Donald Trump	Not even close.
0093	Donald Trump	We're delighted to be joined today by a man who is really, really good at -- he ran one of the largest drug companies, and really successfully, and I took him out.
0094	Donald Trump	Look, that's where, you know, like -- that's where the money is.
0095	Donald Trump	Well, that's where the knowledge is.
0096	Donald Trump	He ran one of the biggest, most successful companies.
0097	Donald Trump	I said, "Alex Azar, come on out.
0098	Donald Trump	I want to get you to be the top person in charge of this."
0099	Donald Trump	I said, "So, let me ask you, how much bigger is this than the company you're in?"
0100	Donald Trump	It's like hundreds of times bigger.
0101	Donald Trump	It's a monster.
0102	Donald Trump	It's a monster.
0103	Donald Trump	And what a job.
0104	Donald Trump	Alex Azar, you know who he is.
0105	Donald Trump	Where is Alex?
0106	Donald Trump	Wherever you are.
0107	Donald Trump	Alex, thank you.
0108	Donald Trump	And he works with Administrator Seema Verma, who has been so incredible.
0109	Donald Trump	Seema, you have to stand up.
0110	Donald Trump	What a job.
0111	Donald Trump	They know the most intricate little quarter sentences.
0112	Donald Trump	You wouldn't believe it.
0113	Donald Trump	I'd say, "What about this?"
0114	Donald Trump	And they'd tell me, "Unfortunately, it's always like a little roadblock, but we figure our way around."
0115	Donald Trump	And somebody else who is going to be lowering your drug prices with us in a very, very short distance.
0116	Donald Trump	We're going to buying them from a slightly different source.
0117	Donald Trump	A little bit unconventional.
0118	Donald Trump	A lot of people say I'm unconventional; sometimes you have to be unconventional.
0119	Donald Trump	And, Alex, when are we are going to let Governor Ron DeSantis and your incredible First Lady Casey DeSantis -- when are they going to be -- when are they going to be able to do what we want to do?
0120	Donald Trump	Alex, when are they going to be able to do what we have to do?
0121	Donald Trump	Soon.
0122	Donald Trump	Alex says, "Soon."
0123	Donald Trump	Because they're going to have a big fat, beautiful surprise for you.
0124	Donald Trump	And that has been an incredible couple and a great governor, and the job they're doing is phenomenal.
0125	Donald Trump	And I was honored to be very much involved in that campaign.
0126	Donald Trump	And if he was doing a lousy job, I'd probably just wouldn't have shown up today.
0127	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But he's doing one of the best jobs in the whole country.
0128	Donald Trump	Ron DeSantis.
0129	Donald Trump	And also helping Ron and Casey: Jeanette Núñez, your Lieutenant Governor.
0130	Donald Trump	Jeanette, thank you.
0131	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0132	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0133	Donald Trump	Thanks, Jeanette.
0134	Donald Trump	Great job.
0135	Donald Trump	Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody.
0136	Donald Trump	Ashley, I saw you down there.
0137	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0138	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0139	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0140	Donald Trump	And a few warriors we have with us.
0141	Donald Trump	You know, Ron was one of our warriors.
0142	Donald Trump	He was in Congress and he was fighting the Russian hoax.
0143	Donald Trump	That was the Russian witch hunt hoax.
0144	Donald Trump	And he was so impressive that when he said, "You know, I'd like to run for governor," I said, "I'd rather keep you right where you are because they'll come up with another crazy idea."
0145	Donald Trump	But I'm glad I did it.
0146	Donald Trump	And it worked out well.
0147	Donald Trump	But we have warriors back in Washington, and you have five of them right here.
0148	Donald Trump	Gus Bilirakis.
0149	Donald Trump	Gus.
0150	Donald Trump	Where's Gus?
0151	Donald Trump	Thank you, Gus.
0152	Donald Trump	Great job.
0153	Donald Trump	The legendary Neal Dunn.
0154	Donald Trump	Neal, thank you.
0155	Donald Trump	These guys are warriors.
0156	Donald Trump	Ross Spano.
0157	Donald Trump	Thanks, Ross.
0158	Donald Trump	Michael Waltz.
0159	Donald Trump	Michael.
0160	Donald Trump	Great job he does on television.
0161	Donald Trump	All of them, they do a great job.
0162	Donald Trump	They're defending us.
0163	Donald Trump	They're not defending me; they're defending us, because that was the greatest election victory maybe in history.
0164	Donald Trump	And they're defending us.
0165	Donald Trump	And a man with one of the best names in the history of politics: Daniel Webster.
0166	Donald Trump	What a name.
0167	Donald Trump	If I had that name, I would've been President 10 years ago.
0168	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Thank you.
0169	Donald Trump	Thanks, Daniel.
0170	Donald Trump	Thanks, everybody.
0171	Donald Trump	Great job.
0172	Donald Trump	They really are -- they're warriors.
0173	Donald Trump	They go back and they fight, and they fight corruption.
0174	Donald Trump	And it's corruption, what's going on right now.
0175	Donald Trump	When you see this going on, it's pure corruption.
0176	Donald Trump	As we gather this afternoon, Medicare is under threat like never before.
0177	Donald Trump	Your know that.
0178	Donald Trump	You have people that are running for office who -- if it ever happened, you will not be very happy here.
0179	Donald Trump	Almost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare.
0180	Donald Trump	These Democrat policy proposals may go by different names -- they have all of these wonderful names like -- [Audience member calls out "Wacko"]
0181	Donald Trump	It'll never end.
0182	Donald Trump	I'm sorry I smiled.
0183	Donald Trump	They'll have me -- the fake news is back there.
0184	Donald Trump	Look at all of them.
0185	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
0186	Donald Trump	They'll say, "It's terrible.
0187	Donald Trump	It's terrible -- the President's smile."
0188	Donald Trump	You know, they want me to admonish you.
0189	Donald Trump	Who said that?
0190	Donald Trump	Lock her up.
0191	Donald Trump	Stand up, please.
0192	Donald Trump	I'm admonishing you.
0193	Donald Trump	Never ever say that again.
0194	Donald Trump	That's okay.
0195	Donald Trump	Sit down.
0196	Donald Trump	[Laughter] He's admonished, so now they can't do their fake number on us.
0197	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0198	Donald Trump	But they may go by different names, whether it's "single-payer" or the so-called "public option," but they're all based on the totally same, terrible idea.
0199	Donald Trump	They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.
0200	Donald Trump	Any socialists in the room?
0201	Donald Trump	I don't think so.
0202	Donald Trump	Not too many.
0203	Donald Trump	Anybody?
0204	Audience	Booo --
0205	Donald Trump	No?
0206	Donald Trump	No?
0207	Donald Trump	Not too many in The villages.
0208	Donald Trump	You don't -- you're not big on socialism down here, right?
0209	Donald Trump	These geniuses -- these real estate geniuses that know we're not -- not too good.
0210	Donald Trump	Every one of these plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, and massively raising taxes.
0211	Donald Trump	They want to raise your taxes.
0212	Donald Trump	They also want to have open borders, so the people can just come in and do whatever they want to do.
0213	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
0214	Donald Trump	And they have no idea who's coming in, by the way.
0215	Donald Trump	They have no idea.
0216	Donald Trump	But, you know, when these countries -- and now we're getting along great with the countries.
0217	Donald Trump	Mexico gave us 27,000 soldiers guarding our border and the numbers are way down.
0218	Donald Trump	Twenty-seven thousand.
0219	Donald Trump	I want to thank Mexico -- the government and the President.
0220	Donald Trump	Congressional Democrats' extreme agenda would destroy our booming economy very quickly.
0221	Donald Trump	One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed.
0222	Donald Trump	That's how they want to finance it.
0223	Donald Trump	Leading Democrats have pledged to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants.
0224	Donald Trump	They put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country -- they put them way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.
0225	Donald Trump	I will never allow these politicians to steal your healthcare and give it away to illegal aliens.
0226	Donald Trump	And now, in New York, I hear they passed a new regulation that, if you use the word, "illegal immigrant" -- did I hear correctly?
0227	Donald Trump	They want to charge you a fine of $250,000.
0228	Donald Trump	In other words, sell your home in The Villages because you happened to say, "We don't like illegal immigrants pouring into our country illegally."
0229	Donald Trump	We want people to come into our country legally, through a process.
0230	Donald Trump	And we're all in favor of that.
0231	Donald Trump	And, by the way, the Fake News will cut that last part of the sentence off.
0232	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They'll just put the first part.
0233	Donald Trump	And they'll say, "Man, is he rough?
0234	Donald Trump	He's too tough.
0235	Donald Trump	I can't vote for him."
0236	Donald Trump	A nation must put its own citizens first.
0237	Donald Trump	My administration is standing up for American seniors.
0238	Donald Trump	And we'll always protect the Medicare benefits you earned and paid for.
0239	Donald Trump	In the last administration, Democrats slashed Medicare by $800 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare.
0240	Donald Trump	Not too good -- Obamacare.
0241	Donald Trump	[Audience Boos]
0242	Donald Trump	Now one of their new proposals, backed by more than 130 Democrat members of Congress, would cost -- listen to this number -- $32 trillion dollars.
0243	Donald Trump	And that's on the low side -- $32 trillion, with a "T".
0244	Donald Trump	We're beyond the "B's", the billions.
0245	Donald Trump	And reduce Americans' household income by $17,000 per year.
0246	Donald Trump	Is there anybody in this room that doesn't mind losing $17,000 a year?
0247	Donald Trump	No?
0248	Donald Trump	In order to get lousy healthcare.
0249	Donald Trump	Though they use many labels, all of the Democrat plans would devastate our healthcare system.
0250	Donald Trump	The fake moderates on the left are telling the same lies they did under the last administration.
0251	Donald Trump	But the last administration, frankly, was moderate compared to the maniacs that you're hearing from today.
0252	Donald Trump	These are maniacs.
0253	Donald Trump	Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren.
0254	Donald Trump	You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone, Ron.
0255	Donald Trump	I thought she was gone.
0256	Donald Trump	She came up from the ashes.
0257	Donald Trump	She emerged.
0258	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Now, we're probably going to have to do it again, because I don't see Sleepy Joe making it, I'll tell you.
0259	Donald Trump	[Laughter] No, I thought she was gone.
0260	Donald Trump	Under this administration, we believe that every American family has a right of choice -- you have a right to choose.
0261	Donald Trump	Choice.
0262	Donald Trump	So important.
0263	Donald Trump	Like what we did with the vets.
0264	Donald Trump	Choice.
0265	Donald Trump	Where they can go out and get a doctor instead of waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, two months.
0266	Donald Trump	Choice.
0267	Donald Trump	And you look at the doctor and you look at the plan that is best for you.
0268	Donald Trump	The truth is, there is no longer a moderate wing of congressional Democrats.
0269	Donald Trump	They've gone crazy.
0270	Donald Trump	They've been hijacked by the radical left.
0271	Donald Trump	I mean, these people on the left, these people are -- [Audience member calls out "Wacko"]
0272	Donald Trump	[Laughs] Is that the same guy?
0273	Donald Trump	I think so.
0274	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I sort of like him.
0275	Donald Trump	I can't admonish him again.
0276	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I think it's the same guy.
0277	Donald Trump	Got a powerful voice.
0278	Donald Trump	Democrat lawmakers are not trying to build up the country; they only want to wreck and destroy all of the things that we've built up over the last three and a half years, four years, five years -- prior to us getting in here.
0279	Donald Trump	You look at the stock market numbers from the time of the election, from that November 9th date, go a date later.
0280	Donald Trump	Wasn't November 8 -- was that one of the great times?
0281	Donald Trump	Huh?
0282	Donald Trump	2016.
0283	Donald Trump	But go a day later, and you look at the numbers in the stock market up way over 50 percent.
0284	Donald Trump	The 401 [K)s are doing unbelievably well.
0285	Donald Trump	One of these people gets in -- your 401(k]s are going to hell, the stock market is going to hell.
0286	Donald Trump	Frankly, I think -- and I hate to say it -- the country is going to go to hell.
0287	Donald Trump	They're consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust for power.
0288	Donald Trump	Well, how about Justice Kavanaugh?
0289	Donald Trump	They talk about a woman -- .
0290	Donald Trump	They talk about a woman, about horrible things that he never even thought about.
0291	Donald Trump	Horrible, horrible things.
0292	Donald Trump	And the following day, they want to impeach him.
0293	Donald Trump	And then, the following day, she said, "No, I don't remember anything.
0294	Donald Trump	I don't remember that."
0295	Donald Trump	And they say, "We don't care.
0296	Donald Trump	We want to impeach him anyway."
0297	Donald Trump	Now, what they're trying to do is turn his vote liberal.
0298	Donald Trump	But he's a much tougher guy than that.
0299	Donald Trump	I hope.
0300	Donald Trump	[Laughs] He's a much tougher guy.
0301	Donald Trump	[Audience members calls out "So are you"]
0302	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0303	Donald Trump	Yeah, I better be.
0304	Donald Trump	I'll tell you.
0305	Donald Trump	If I weren't, I wouldn't be up here right now.
0306	Donald Trump	With all that we have to put up with these people, we wouldn't be here.
0307	Donald Trump	Democrat healthcare proposals would put everyone into a single, socialist, government-run program that would end private insurance for over 180 million Americans.
0308	Donald Trump	I'm sort of smiling to myself as I -- as I go through these numbers.
0309	Donald Trump	And I'm dealing with people that I know.
0310	Donald Trump	I mean, I know the people in this room.
0311	Donald Trump	Those are the people.
0312	Donald Trump	I grew up with you.
0313	Donald Trump	When we were young, I grew up with you.
0314	Donald Trump	And now we're sort of still young at heart, at least.
0315	Donald Trump	And that I'm even talking about socialism is like -- it's just -- it's sort of a weird feeling to be talking to you about "you don't want to be socialist."
0316	Donald Trump	And you're probably saying, "Why is he wasting his time?"
0317	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But there's a movement on.
0318	Donald Trump	And it's not so easy to be beat them when they get up in a debate and they say, "We're going to cut your college tuition to nothing.
0319	Donald Trump	We're going kno- -- knock off $1.6 trillion.
0320	Donald Trump	We're going to do all these other things.
0321	Donald Trump	Everything is free, except for your taxes."
0322	Donald Trump	Your taxes are going to go up at a level that nobody has even seen before and that won't be nearly enough to pay for it.
0323	Donald Trump	But I'll not let any of this bad stuff happen.
0324	Donald Trump	It's very important that we win this race.
0325	Donald Trump	You know, when we won last time, I said, "That's the most important election in our country's history."
0326	Donald Trump	Because we were ready to go over the edge.
0327	Donald Trump	And now our country is doing great.
0328	Donald Trump	But, you know, it's like a plant -- it's like a tree.
0329	Donald Trump	It has to grab -- those roots have to grab hold.
0330	Donald Trump	We still need more time.
0331	Donald Trump	We've done so much, but we need a little more time.
0332	Donald Trump	That thing has to grow and it's got to get in there and then nobody is going to be able to take it down no matter what happens later on.
0333	Donald Trump	So important.
0334	Donald Trump	In America, we believe in freedom and liberty, not government domination and government control.
0335	Donald Trump	Today, standing in solidarity with our nation's seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country -- it will never be.
0336	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0337	Donald Trump	[Audience chants "Four more years"]
0338	Donald Trump	You want to drive them crazy?
0339	Donald Trump	Don't do "four more years."
0340	Donald Trump	Say "eight more years."
0341	Donald Trump	You'll drive them crazy.
0342	Donald Trump	[Laughter] One of these crazy maniacs on a show was interviewing somebody -- radical Left -- and he goes, "You know he's going to win, don't you?"
0343	Donald Trump	Big show.
0344	Donald Trump	And the guy goes, "No, no.
0345	Donald Trump	We're going to fight him.
0346	Donald Trump	We're going to…" "No, no, no.
0347	Donald Trump	He's going to win.
0348	Donald Trump	And you know he's never getting out.
0349	Donald Trump	You know that don't you?"
0350	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "He's not going to get out.
0351	Donald Trump	You know he's…" And I thought, like -- you know, he's a comedian.
0352	Donald Trump	I thought he was like kidding and having fun.
0353	Donald Trump	He meant it.
0354	Donald Trump	[Laughter] These people are sick.
0355	Donald Trump	They meant it.
0356	Donald Trump	Anyway -- but, no, if you want to drive them crazy, just say "eight more years" or "twelve more years" -- [Laughter] -- or "sixteen."
0357	Donald Trump	Sixteen would do it good.
0358	Donald Trump	They would -- [Laughter] -- you would really drive them into the loony bin.
0359	Donald Trump	And that's why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can't beat us fairly.
0360	Donald Trump	That's the only reason they're doing it.
0361	Donald Trump	They can't win.
0362	Donald Trump	They can't win.
0363	Donald Trump	If they won, it would be a sad day for our country.
0364	Donald Trump	It'll be a sad, sad day for our country if they ever won.
0365	Donald Trump	Among those who would be hit hardest by the socialist takeover are 24 million seniors on Medicare Advantage -- a lot of you.
0366	Donald Trump	One out of two Hispanic seniors, one out of three African-American seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage.
0367	Donald Trump	This very popular Medicare program -- been around for a long time -- allows private plans to compete to offer senior citizens the absolute best healthcare.
0368	Donald Trump	They want to destroy it.
0369	Donald Trump	While many Democrat plans would eliminate Medicare Advantage, my administration is fighting to make it even better and much, much stronger.
0370	Donald Trump	And thanks to our efforts, there are nearly 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were just two years ago.
0371	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0372	Donald Trump	Premiums have plummeted by 28 percent; they've gone down.
0373	Donald Trump	And they're now at the lowest level in over 10 years.
0374	Donald Trump	With us today is Corey Spangler.
0375	Donald Trump	She lives just up the road in Summerfield.
0376	Donald Trump	Corey, please tell us some of what we've been discussing on Medicare Advantage and your plan, and how important it is to you.
0377	Donald Trump	Please, come up, Corey, wherever you may be.
0378	Donald Trump	Oh, Corey.
0379	Corey Spangler	I'm right here.
0380	Corey Spangler	[Laughter]
0381	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
0382	Corey Spangler	Okay.
0383	Corey Spangler	My family came to America from Mexico when I was five years old because my father did not like the corruption and we had socialized medicine there.
0384	Corey Spangler	He came to this country legally.
0385	Corey Spangler	And when I turned 65, I had some heart issues.
0386	Corey Spangler	I went to the doctor.
0387	Corey Spangler	They scheduled me with a cardiologist.
0388	Corey Spangler	He scheduled me for a stress test on a Wednesday.
0389	Corey Spangler	Pass -- I didn't -- I failed that test.
0390	Corey Spangler	So he scheduled me for a heart cath the next day.
0391	Corey Spangler	I failed that.
0392	Corey Spangler	They told me you need to have a bypass and I was going to have five bypasses done.
0393	Corey Spangler	The following Monday, I was in surgery with my five pass -- five bypasses, and I went home the following Friday.
0394	Corey Spangler	This would never happen with Medicare for All.
0395	Corey Spangler	I love my Medicare Advantage plan, because I can choose the doctor, when I need it, and get the care I need in a quickly manner.
0396	Corey Spangler	And it wouldn't happen with Medicare for All.
0397	Donald Trump	That's beautiful.
0398	Corey Spangler	Thank you, Mr. President, for saving my care -- healthcare.
0399	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
0400	Donald Trump	I see a future politician there.
0401	Donald Trump	That was -- [Laughter] -- boy, she was so like calm.
0402	Donald Trump	No nerves.
0403	Donald Trump	You know, sometimes I'll see people, they get a little bit nervous.
0404	Donald Trump	Very good.
0405	Donald Trump	What a job they've done.
0406	Donald Trump	Great doctors.
0407	Donald Trump	Did you choose your own doctor or you get lucky with a good doctor that was recommended?
0408	Corey Spangler	They were wonderful.
0409	Donald Trump	They were wonderful.
0410	Donald Trump	That's fantastic.
0411	Donald Trump	And you're wonderful.
0412	Donald Trump	Thank you, Corey.
0413	Donald Trump	Appreciate it.
0414	Donald Trump	The Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they'll also deny your treatment and everything that you need.
0415	Donald Trump	Government-run healthcare systems always end up imposing rationing.
0416	Donald Trump	You see what happens.
0417	Donald Trump	You look at Venezuela; take a look at that.
0418	Donald Trump	Fifteen years ago, it's one of the wealthiest countries.
0419	Donald Trump	Now they don't have food.
0420	Donald Trump	They don't have water.
0421	Donald Trump	The hospitals are a disaster.
0422	Donald Trump	No electricity.
0423	Donald Trump	No anything.
0424	Donald Trump	It's very sad.
0425	Donald Trump	And we're helping the people as much as we can.
0426	Donald Trump	But we're watching that whole situation -- beyond this, we're watching it very, very carefully.
0427	Donald Trump	We're watching it very carefully.
0428	Donald Trump	And Cuba -- we're watching Cuba very carefully.
0429	Donald Trump	Very, very carefully.
0430	Donald Trump	But as an example, under the United Kingdom's single-payer system, patients wait 117 days to receive, as an example, a knee replacement.
0431	Donald Trump	One hundred and seventeen days.
0432	Donald Trump	In Canada, wait times for orthopedic surgery are over 270 days.
0433	Donald Trump	But currently in the United States, wait times for these surgeries are -- we've speeded it up a lot -- are typically less than two weeks.
0434	Donald Trump	Is that right, Alex?
0435	Donald Trump	And I have many people coming down from Canada, and I say, "What are you doing?"
0436	Donald Trump	They're getting an operation of some kind.
0437	Donald Trump	Why don't you get it up there?
0438	Donald Trump	They said, "There's nothing like what you've been able to do in a short period of time."
0439	Donald Trump	And we're making it even better.
0440	Donald Trump	With us today is Charles McLaughlin, a 71-year-old Floridian and a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War.
0441	Donald Trump	Charles, please come up and tell us your story.
0442	Donald Trump	Please.
0443	Charles McLaughlin	Oh, man.
0444	Charles McLaughlin	Hello to The Villages!
0445	Charles McLaughlin	What a great place you guys have here.
0446	Charles McLaughlin	Wow.
0447	Charles McLaughlin	I understand that approximately 60 percent of all of you are veterans.
0448	Charles McLaughlin	I want to say thank you for your service.
0449	Charles McLaughlin	And to my Vietnam brothers and sisters: Welcome home.
0450	Charles McLaughlin	Welcome home.
0451	Charles McLaughlin	My name is Chuck McLaughlin, and I'm a Vietnam combat Marine.
0452	Charles McLaughlin	I'm also a cancer survivor -- Stage 4 style.
0453	Charles McLaughlin	I know a lot about Medicare and the supplement.
0454	Charles McLaughlin	I used it for breathing tubes, feeding tubes, stitches, staples, MRIs, PET scans, CAT scans, blood tests, hydration shots, chemo treatments, radiation treatments, six months of hypobaric chamber -- to name a few.
0455	Charles McLaughlin	Anyone that's cured, like me, loves their doctors.
0456	Charles McLaughlin	Loves their doctors.
0457	Charles McLaughlin	I also want to say: My family, financially, would've been destroyed without Medicare.
0458	Charles McLaughlin	Destroyed.
0459	Charles McLaughlin	The facts are now [Inaudible] the politicians on the left are pushing Medicare for All.
0460	Charles McLaughlin	I say the result will be no Medicare at all.
0461	Charles McLaughlin	It will collapse under the load -- the load of the system.
0462	Charles McLaughlin	It will overload of it.
0463	Charles McLaughlin	The lines would be incredible.
0464	Charles McLaughlin	Who knows?
0465	Charles McLaughlin	I probably wouldn't be here.
0466	Charles McLaughlin	As far as free stuff, it may be free stuff, but it's going to come out of somebody else's pocket.
0467	Charles McLaughlin	There's no such thing as "free."
0468	Charles McLaughlin	Period.
0469	Charles McLaughlin	Is the Medicare system perfect?
0470	Charles McLaughlin	No.
0471	Charles McLaughlin	But it worked for me.
0472	Charles McLaughlin	Remember, I paid my share.
0473	Charles McLaughlin	Just a few thoughts: President Trump's plan of Medicare Advantage will give me more flexibility for options to this system.
0474	Charles McLaughlin	I can pick and choose my needs.
0475	Charles McLaughlin	Secondly, a program that helps protect us seniors for a fair shake as our bodies fail us.
0476	Charles McLaughlin	And number three, we must get rid of the waste and fraud that seems to be in the newspapers weekly.
0477	Charles McLaughlin	Finally, thank you, President Trump, for all you do.
0478	Charles McLaughlin	I want to personally thank him for what he does for our veterans.
0479	Charles McLaughlin	Finally, and may God bless you and your family for loving America and giving us a renewed hope for our children and our grandchildren.
0480	Charles McLaughlin	Thank you.
0481	Donald Trump	What a great job.
0482	Donald Trump	Well, thank you very much, Charles.
0483	Donald Trump	And it's incredible.
0484	Donald Trump	You've gone through a lot.
0485	Charles McLaughlin	Yep.
0486	Donald Trump	You don't look it.
0487	Donald Trump	[Laughter] He's looking handsome to me, I'll tell you.
0488	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Thanks, Charles.
0489	Donald Trump	That's incredible.
0490	Donald Trump	Like you, all of us today understand the truth.
0491	Donald Trump	Socialism is not about improving the health of American people; it's about wielding power over the American people, taking things away from the American people.
0492	Donald Trump	In a few moments, I will sign an executive order to strengthen Medicare for seniors, and very substantially.
0493	Donald Trump	I'll provide Medicare Advantage plans with new tools and options, and it will help Medicare beneficiaries gain faster access to the very latest and greatest medical devices and therapies.
0494	Donald Trump	My order also pursues reductions in the unnecessary regulations that you don't need, you don't want to see -- that never come into effect and that cost a lot of money -- enabling doctors and nurses to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients that they love.
0495	Donald Trump	To further protect seniors, we are taking action to stop fraud and to stop abuse.
0496	Donald Trump	It's tremendous amounts of money saved with that.
0497	Donald Trump	And we'll be able to put that money right back into what we want to have it to take care of you.
0498	Donald Trump	I'm directing Secretary Azar to crack down on criminals, cheaters, and dishonest providers who rob Medicare of the funds you have and the money that you've paid into the system all of your lives.
0499	Donald Trump	Charles said it.
0500	Donald Trump	Charles said, "You know, I paid for it."
0501	Donald Trump	He said he paid for it.
0502	Donald Trump	And now they want to say, "Let's give it to everybody else."
0503	Donald Trump	And it's going to be gone in a very short number of years.
0504	Donald Trump	But you did pay for it.
0505	Donald Trump	You both paid for it.
0506	Donald Trump	Today's action is the only really great action that we can take.
0507	Donald Trump	It's the only choice we have because this is going to be something that's better than any place anywhere in the world.
0508	Donald Trump	It's the latest of many important steps that we're taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American people.
0509	Donald Trump	Our vision for the future of health in America has four crucial parts.
0510	Donald Trump	And we will protect vulnerable patients, number one.
0511	Donald Trump	We will protect those patients that are so terribly vulnerable.
0512	Donald Trump	We will deliver the affordability that you need.
0513	Donald Trump	Prices coming down.
0514	Donald Trump	As I said, prescription drug prices -- first time in over 50 years, Alex, that drug prices have come down for the year.
0515	Donald Trump	Your average prescription drug price -- first time in 50 years -- over 50 years.
0516	Donald Trump	And we're going to get them a lot lower.
0517	Donald Trump	And I think Ron is going to have some big surprises.
0518	Donald Trump	We'll be announcing that pretty soon.
0519	Donald Trump	Some -- for really, really big reductions.
0520	Donald Trump	People are already -- they're not even going to know what happened.
0521	Donald Trump	So that's what we want.
0522	Donald Trump	And we're going to give you options and control that you want.
0523	Donald Trump	And we will provide the quality you deserve.
0524	Donald Trump	First, we're protecting vulnerable Americans.
0525	Donald Trump	We have made a clear promise to America's patients: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.
0526	Donald Trump	The Republicans will always protect preexisting conditions.
0527	Donald Trump	To stop families from being blindsided by outrageous medical bills -- and this is something that is one of the most exciting things to me -- I have challenged Congress to send a bill to my desk that stops the horrendous practice of surprise medical billing.
0528	Donald Trump	So many of you, you go in and you have something, and then you get a bill and you say, "How is it possible?"
0529	Donald Trump	And we're going to end that practice.
0530	Donald Trump	That practice is not a fair practice.
0531	Donald Trump	And we're also confronting the opioid and drug addiction epidemic that is plaguing too many American communities.
0532	Donald Trump	And thanks to our efforts -- and we've worked so hard on it; the First Lady worked so hard.
0533	Donald Trump	Kellyanne Conway -- where's Kellyanne?
0534	Donald Trump	Where's Kellyanne?
0535	Donald Trump	Where is she?
0536	Donald Trump	Kellyanne, thank you.
0537	Donald Trump	Thank you, Kellyanne.
0538	Donald Trump	Last year, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly three decades.
0539	Donald Trump	Early data shows that drug overdose deaths dropped 10 percent last year in the state of Florida.
0540	Donald Trump	Now, think of that.
0541	Donald Trump	That's -- you know, we'd like to better.
0542	Donald Trump	It's a very, very tough situation.
0543	Donald Trump	And one of the things we're doing with the "pain pills" -- we can call them -- we're trying to find, and we're really working hard and we're funding a lot of research to find pain pills that aren't addictive.
0544	Donald Trump	You go into to a hospital with a broken arm, and you come out and you're drug addict.
0545	Donald Trump	And we're trying to find, and we're getting closer -- I think we're getting very close, actually -- to finding painkillers that aren't addictive.
0546	Donald Trump	And we'll have that in the not-too-distant future.
0547	Donald Trump	And to care for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability.
0548	Donald Trump	You know what that is, right?
0549	Donald Trump	This is where the great heroes and tough people -- but -- and, by the way, in their super prime, nobody touched them.
0550	Donald Trump	But they're more vulnerable, and people would take advantage of our veterans.
0551	Donald Trump	You had sadists.
0552	Donald Trump	You had people that would rob them and rob the system.
0553	Donald Trump	You had some horrible people.
0554	Donald Trump	We couldn't fire anybody.
0555	Donald Trump	They had, in Arizona, people that got stealing -- they got caught stealing $400,000.
0556	Donald Trump	They couldn't fire them.
0557	Donald Trump	So now we have VA Accountability.
0558	Donald Trump	You think that was easy?
0559	Donald Trump	They've been trying to get it for 50 years.
0560	Donald Trump	And I got it.
0561	Donald Trump	I'm good at getting things.
0562	Donald Trump	So now, when they don't take proper care of our vets, we say, "Jim, get the hell out of here.
0563	Donald Trump	You're fired.
0564	Donald Trump	Get out of here."
0565	Donald Trump	We can fire them.
0566	Donald Trump	Get them out.
0567	Donald Trump	We get them out.
0568	Donald Trump	We don't have to ask questions.
0569	Donald Trump	We get them out.
0570	Donald Trump	If they're bad, they treat our veterans badly, we fire them.
0571	Donald Trump	That's why you don't hear about -- you know, before me, every night you'd see these stories, these horror stories about the VA.
0572	Donald Trump	I haven't seen one in a long time.
0573	Donald Trump	Now, I don't want to wish it because the fake news will search the system -- [Laughter] -- to find somebody that's not happy.
0574	Donald Trump	We found somebody.
575	Donald Trump	We found a vet in Florida who isn't quite happy with everything.
576	Donald Trump	Let's do a major story.
0577	Donald Trump	But do you remember all of the bad stories that used to be about the VA?
0578	Donald Trump	Now you don't see that because they have accountability.
0579	Donald Trump	We can fire bad people.
0580	Donald Trump	We fired a tremendous number of really bad people that should've been fired years ago.
0581	Donald Trump	I don't like firing people, but I like firing people that don't treat our vets great, that aren't doing their job.
0582	Donald Trump	And they were protected, frankly, by the unions, and they were protected by civil service -- very powerful.
0583	Donald Trump	Do you think it was easy beating unions and civil service?
0584	Donald Trump	Not too easy.
0585	Donald Trump	But I explained to them too.
0586	Donald Trump	I said, "This is good for all of us.
0587	Donald Trump	It's good for America."
0588	Donald Trump	And the other, as I said, is VA Choice, where our veterans no longer have to wait for endless, endless hours, days -- even months.
0589	Donald Trump	We've had cases where a person is on line -- not bad; could be fixed up very easily with whatever treatment it may be -- and they end up being terminal by the time they see a doctor.
0590	Donald Trump	That's not happening anymore.
0591	Donald Trump	Because now you go out, you find a great local doctor, we pay the bill.
0592	Donald Trump	And, you know, it's interesting, it's totally less important but we also save a lot of money on that.
0593	Donald Trump	Hard to believe, we save a lot of money.
0594	Donald Trump	It's much less expensive for us to do that than the other way, and it's saving tremendous numbers of lives.
0595	Donald Trump	And we have great doctors, frankly, that need the business.
0596	Donald Trump	Not so bad.
0597	Donald Trump	To protect healthcare for our seniors and all Americans, my administration is taking strong actions to ensure that newcomers to our society do not drain our healthcare system, or burden the services that you depend on.
0598	Donald Trump	You see these people in California, the governor of California -- "Come on in, everybody."
0599	Donald Trump	Then you wonder why people are flooding our borders.
0600	Donald Trump	Come on in.
0601	Donald Trump	You have free education, free healthcare.
0602	Donald Trump	Everybody gets a Rolls-Royce.
0603	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "Come on in.
0604	Donald Trump	Come on in."
0605	Donald Trump	You know, to show you how corrupt CNN is, when I used that expression, they said, "The President wasn't telling the truth.
0606	Donald Trump	He said they get a Rolls-Royce and they don't."
0607	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Ahh, they don't get it, do they?
0608	Donald Trump	They never got it.
0609	Donald Trump	Some idiot at CNN said, "You can't win without CNN.
0610	Donald Trump	I guess we showed them."
0611	Donald Trump	[Laughter] I guess we showed them.
0612	Donald Trump	And their ratings are so low now that they are no longer the big difference at all.
0613	Donald Trump	They have really bad ratings.
0614	Donald Trump	But you know what is bad for our country?
0615	Donald Trump	When CNN -- so often I go to a foreign country.
0616	Donald Trump	I go to a country.
0617	Donald Trump	I meet leaders.
0618	Donald Trump	And he said, "Why do they hate your country so much?"
0619	Donald Trump	I said, "Who?"
0620	Donald Trump	You know, CNN outside of the United States is much more important than it is in the United States.
0621	Donald Trump	And a lot of what you see here is broadcast throughout the world.
0622	Donald Trump	And we used to have Radio Free -- I think Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.
0623	Donald Trump	And we did that to build up our country.
0624	Donald Trump	And that's not working out too well.
0625	Donald Trump	But CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there.
0626	Donald Trump	And it's a terrible thing for our country.
0627	Donald Trump	And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.
0628	Donald Trump	They are so bad for our country.
0629	Donald Trump	They are so bad for our country.
0630	Donald Trump	I go out there and they say, "Boy, the media hates your country."
0631	Donald Trump	And it's just a shame.
0632	Donald Trump	It's just a shame.
0633	Donald Trump	And we really are -- we are looking at that.
0634	Donald Trump	We should do something about it, too.
0635	Donald Trump	Put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that's fake.
0636	Donald Trump	When Americans are struck by natural disaster, like they were in Florida where I was with you, Hurricane Michael -- did I do a good job, Governor?
0637	Donald Trump	Did I do a good job?
0638	Donald Trump	Man.
0639	Donald Trump	Your governor came to my office once a week.
0640	Donald Trump	He always needed more money -- [Laughter] -- and I always gave it, right?
0641	Donald Trump	He didn't stop.
0642	Donald Trump	I hated it.
0643	Donald Trump	I said, "Keep DeSantis.
0644	Donald Trump	I don't want to see him anymore."
0645	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But we always gave it, and you got it.
0646	Donald Trump	And your people worked so hard.
0647	Donald Trump	And FEMA and the military, they all worked with you.
0648	Donald Trump	The Coast Guard is incredible, what the Coast Guard has done.
0649	Donald Trump	I think the Coast Guard has really done a great job.
0650	Donald Trump	The second part of our healthcare agenda is to promote the affordability of America's needs.
0651	Donald Trump	Thanks to our focus on lower drug prices, the FDA approved more low-cost generic drugs in my first two years than ever before in the history of our country.
0652	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0653	Donald Trump	Think of that.
0654	Donald Trump	And every time I'd see the folks over at FDA, I'd say, "Come on, fellas.
0655	Donald Trump	Let's go.
0656	Donald Trump	Faster.
0657	Donald Trump	Faster."
0658	Donald Trump	You know, don't forget, when somebody was dying and we had a drug that looked like it was really good but it wasn't going be approved for like four more years -- it used to be 12 years and we brought it way down.
0659	Donald Trump	I mean, it's too long.
0660	Donald Trump	But we brought it way, way down.
0661	Donald Trump	But a person is dying and they said, "No, sir, we can't give that because it may harm the person."
0662	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait a minute, you don't understand."
0663	Donald Trump	[Laughter] "A person is terminally ill, they've got four weeks to live, and you don't want to give them a drug because you think it's going to harm them?
0664	Donald Trump	I guarantee you I can get them to sign a document."
0665	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Now we got that approved -- Right to Try.
0666	Donald Trump	And, by the way, miracles are happening.
0667	Donald Trump	Right?
0668	Donald Trump	Miracles.
0669	Donald Trump	Miracles are happening.
0670	Donald Trump	Hopefully, it never happens to anybody in this room.
0671	Donald Trump	But, frankly, people would go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world seeking a cure, if they had money.
0672	Donald Trump	If they didn't have money, they'd go home and they'd die.
0673	Donald Trump	But now they don't have to do that.
0674	Donald Trump	And it wasn't easy because the drug companies didn't want it because they didn't want to have terminally ill because it looks bad on the percentage record, right?
0675	Donald Trump	The insurance companies didn't want it because there are a lot of reasons.
0676	Donald Trump	You know what the reasons are.
0677	Donald Trump	Our government didn't want it because they didn't want to be sued by a patient that died that would've died anyway.
0678	Donald Trump	So I said, "Here's what we do, folks: We sign an agreement.
0679	Donald Trump	And the agreement holds everybody non-liable."
0680	Donald Trump	We took the drug companies and we created a separate list, so they're not on that list -- because it is, right?
0681	Donald Trump	It's a problem.
0682	Donald Trump	And we took a separate list.
0683	Donald Trump	So now we have a totally separate list -- confidential list -- but they don't get hurt by somebody that was so sick that this person may not make it.
0684	Donald Trump	And I got everybody to sign it and we were done.
0685	Donald Trump	It was pretty amazing.
0686	Donald Trump	And then we got it approved in Congress because of these five great congressmen back there, including Ron, who at the time was in Congress.
0687	Donald Trump	Right?
0688	Donald Trump	With Greg and everybody, we got it done and we got the Senate to approve it.
0689	Donald Trump	And I signed it.
0690	Donald Trump	And I was really happy.
0691	Donald Trump	Right to Try.
0692	Donald Trump	Hopefully you never need it.
0693	Donald Trump	We also ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling you about cheaper options at the pharmacy counter.
0694	Donald Trump	Do you believe it?
0695	Donald Trump	I thought this was -- I thought they were kidding me the first time.
0696	Donald Trump	Don't forget, I've only been doing this for three years, okay?
0697	Donald Trump	So, you know.
0698	Donald Trump	[Laughter] These guys have been doing it a long time.
0699	Donald Trump	But they're not allowed to talk to you about pricing.
0700	Donald Trump	I said, "Wait.
0701	Donald Trump	You've got to be kidding."
0702	Donald Trump	And they weren't.
0703	Donald Trump	But I got rid of that.
0704	Donald Trump	Now they can talk about pricing.
0705	Donald Trump	You can go out and price.
0706	Donald Trump	You can go to different places.
0707	Donald Trump	They have to be open and transparent.
0708	Donald Trump	That was a big deal.
0709	Donald Trump	That was a big deal.
0710	Donald Trump	And all of these things, you know, they sound so simple; they're tough to get.
0711	Donald Trump	They've been that way for many years for a reason.
0712	Donald Trump	You have very powerful lobbyists.
0713	Donald Trump	You have drug companies, frankly, that don't want that.
0714	Donald Trump	Why would they want that, where you can negotiate price?
0715	Donald Trump	Why would they want a thing like that?
0716	Donald Trump	My administration is also working to require drug companies to disclose prices in their television advertisements.
0717	Donald Trump	And we're almost getting to a point where we're going to be able to get that.
0718	Donald Trump	So you're going to know what you're paying up front.
0719	Donald Trump	They can't triple-hit you.
0720	Donald Trump	Essentially, we're holding Big Pharma accountable.
0721	Donald Trump	And that's okay; they do just fine.
0722	Donald Trump	Earlier this year, we announced another groundbreaking action seniors have wanted for decades.
0723	Donald Trump	We will soon allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from other countries, including the country of Canada, where, believe it or not, they pay much less money for the exact same drug.
0724	Donald Trump	Stand up, Ron.
0725	Donald Trump	Boy, he wants this so badly.
0726	Donald Trump	No, I mean, you go to some countries and the price is like 50, 60 percent lower -- even more than that, I guess, Ron, in some cases.
0727	Donald Trump	And it's 50, 60 percent lower -- the exact same pill, from the exact same factory, from the exact same company.
0728	Donald Trump	And I say, "Why is it that in Europe -- certain places, in particular -- it's 25 percent of what we pay back here?"
0729	Donald Trump	I said, "It must be a different manufacturer."
0730	Donald Trump	No, sir, it's the same one.
0731	Donald Trump	Must be made in a different factory.
0732	Donald Trump	No, sir, it's the same one.
0733	Donald Trump	Everything is identical; they pay 25 percent.
0734	Donald Trump	We pick up all of the research and development.
0735	Donald Trump	We pick up everything like a bunch of, excuse me, schmucks.
0736	Donald Trump	[Laughter] Schmucks.
0737	Donald Trump	Right?
0738	Donald Trump	Not anymore, folks, because in a little while -- in a little while, your governor is going to be able to go out and negotiate until his heart is content.
0739	Donald Trump	And he's going to go to Canada.
0740	Donald Trump	I know he's gone there already and he's looking at their pricing, and he's going to some of the European countries and others, and he's going to get his drug price down to a level that you can't believe.
0741	Donald Trump	It's going to be a great thing.
0742	Donald Trump	And we'll see what happens.
0743	Donald Trump	It's going to be very interesting.
0744	Donald Trump	And I have a feeling when that happens, the drug companies are just going to say, "We can't have this."
0745	Donald Trump	And they're going to drop their price, I think.
0746	Donald Trump	Now, they're very smart.
0747	Donald Trump	They may go the other way, and if they do, don't blame me, okay?
0748	Donald Trump	[Laughter] But I'm pretty sure you're going to do fantastically, Ron.
0749	Donald Trump	You feel good about it?
0750	Donald Trump	Huh?
0751	Donald Trump	You better do good; otherwise, you're making us both look bad.
0752	Donald Trump	[Laughter] You hear that, Casey?
0753	Donald Trump	American patients must no longer be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in other countries through higher prices in America.
0754	Donald Trump	That's what we were doing.
0755	Donald Trump	We were paying a much higher price.
0756	Donald Trump	My administration will never stop fighting for lower costs for American patients and American seniors.
0757	Donald Trump	The third part of our healthcare vision is to provide the choice and control Americans want.
0758	Donald Trump	We eliminated Obamacare's horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate.
0759	Donald Trump	A total disaster.
0760	Donald Trump	That was a big penalty.
0761	Donald Trump	That was a big thing.
0762	Donald Trump	Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay a lot of money for the privilege of having no healthcare.
0763	Donald Trump	You paid not to have healthcare.
0764	Donald Trump	It was a penalty.
0765	Donald Trump	And how it ever held up in Supreme Court, I don't know, but it did.
0766	Donald Trump	But we just got rid of it.
0767	Donald Trump	We just did it the old-fashioned way: We got rid of it.
0768	Donald Trump	We vastly expanded affordable insurance options, including association health plans, short-term plans, and health reimbursement arrangements -- which are incredible.
0769	Donald Trump	And many of these options are up to 60 percent less expensive than "O-bomb-a-care."
0770	Donald Trump	Nobody got that.
0771	Donald Trump	[Laughs] Nobody got that.
0772	Donald Trump	That's okay.
0773	Donald Trump	O-bomb-a-care.
0774	Donald Trump	I didn't say "Obamacare."
0775	Donald Trump	I said "O-bomb-a-care."
0776	Donald Trump	[Laughter] President "O-bomb-a-care."
0777	Donald Trump	He can have it.
0778	Donald Trump	But we've done a great job in running it.
0779	Donald Trump	We almost had it done.
0780	Donald Trump	We unfortunately had one vote -- middle of the night -- just when thumbs down.
0781	Donald Trump	That wasn't good.
0782	Donald Trump	After years and years of campaigning -- "repeal and replace," right?
0783	Donald Trump	But we've done a great job because we get rid of the individual mandate.
0784	Donald Trump	And we're running it better.
0785	Donald Trump	It's still no good, because it's too expensive.
0786	Donald Trump	The premium is way too high and all of the elements of it.
0787	Donald Trump	It's just not good.
0788	Donald Trump	But we're coming up with an incredible plan that if the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we're going to have a fantastic plan.
0789	Donald Trump	Right?
0790	Donald Trump	Following my administration's recommendation, Florida has taken an important step to lower cost and increase choice by repealing a misguided Certificate of Need law, used by hospitals to block competition.
0791	Donald Trump	We encourage other states to follow Florida's example.
0792	Donald Trump	They've done a great job right here.
0793	Donald Trump	And I also signed, just recently, a revolutionary executive order requiring price and quality transparency.
0794	Donald Trump	And the man who's really the leader in the world of this -- it's transparency.
0795	Donald Trump	You can pick your doctor; you can look at their records; you can see how well they did.
0796	Donald Trump	You can go and negotiate.
0797	Donald Trump	A man -- what really sold me on it -- the man who's the best in the world at it, who we used, and we gave you the max plan.
0798	Donald Trump	Did we give that?
0799	Donald Trump	The max plan, right?
0800	Donald Trump	That's the maximum plan.
0801	Donald Trump	We gave it to you.
0802	Donald Trump	And he said something that I loved.
0803	Donald Trump	He said, "Sir, this is more important and will go down as more important than any healthcare that you'll ever come up with."
0804	Donald Trump	And I said, "I like the sound of that."
0805	Donald Trump	Now, who knows if it's true, but I guess, from what I'm hearing, they've done it in certain limited areas and it's phenomenal.
0806	Donald Trump	And it's really transparency.
0807	Donald Trump	And you'll be able to negotiate all over the place.
0808	Donald Trump	And you'll be able to pick everything you want, from the hospital to the doctor.
0809	Donald Trump	And it's going to save you a tremendous amount of money.
0810	Donald Trump	And there are those that say it's more important than even healthcare at a high -- at a high level.
0811	Donald Trump	And fourth, my administration is fighting to ensure the high-quality care that Americans deserve.
0812	Donald Trump	Americans have to get the highest quality.
0813	Donald Trump	So we have the highest quality that Americans deserve.
0814	Donald Trump	On behalf of 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, I signed into law a $1 billion increase in funding for critical Alzheimer's research.
0815	Donald Trump	And we've made a lot of progress.
0816	Donald Trump	And just one other thing I will tell you -- because it even surprised me -- but we've funded it now, and, within 10 years, our country will be AIDS-free.
0817	Donald Trump	Can you believe that?
0818	Donald Trump	AIDS-free.
0819	Donald Trump	Tremendous progress has been made.
0820	Donald Trump	And when we were talking about that, I said, "I don't understand.
0821	Donald Trump	How does this…" It's like somewhat of a secret, but it's incredible -- the tremendous progress that we've made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research.
0822	Donald Trump	And we should be essentially AIDS-free.
0823	Donald Trump	Do you agree with that, Mr. Secretary?
0824	Donald Trump	In my State of the Union, I announced a plan to invest -- [Laughs] -- she liked it -- $500 million dollars in new treatments, and cures, and all of the things that we have to go through with our incredible children, in some cases, for childhood cancers.
0825	Donald Trump	It's a tremendous problem.
0826	Donald Trump	And to bring new hope to the nearly 100,000 Americans currently awaiting a kidney operation, I signed an executive order that will significantly increase the supply of kidneys available for transplant.
0827	Donald Trump	It's such a big deal.
0828	Donald Trump	It's so big.
0829	Donald Trump	You have no idea.
0830	Donald Trump	And we worked hard on that.
0831	Donald Trump	And, you know, what a lot of people don't know -- a lot of it is just the work.
0832	Donald Trump	The people die fairly quickly because it's not -- they could go on forever.
0833	Donald Trump	But it's -- it's unbelievable amounts of work, going in all the time for step-by-step -- what you have to do.
0834	Donald Trump	And so, with kidney transplants, we're making tremendous progress.
0835	Donald Trump	And we funded a lot of money toward it.
0836	Donald Trump	And I think it's going to be a tremendous thing for people that are just literally suffering with something they can really do very well with.
0837	Donald Trump	We're delivering better, fairer, and more affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially our cherished senior citizens.
0838	Donald Trump	And we will stop at nothing to deliver better healthcare for you and for your family.
0839	Donald Trump	I will never let you down.
0840	Donald Trump	You have been incredible to me and I will never ever forget you.
0841	Donald Trump	I will never let you down.
0842	Donald Trump	I promise that.
0843	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0844	Donald Trump	Thank you very much.
0845	Donald Trump	We're lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies.
0846	Donald Trump	And you think that's easy?
0847	Donald Trump	It's not easy.
0848	Donald Trump	It's not easy.
0849	Donald Trump	They come at you from all different sides.
0850	Donald Trump	I wouldn't be surprised if the hoax didn't come a little bit from some of the people that we're taking on.
0851	Donald Trump	They're very powerful.
0852	Donald Trump	They spend a lot of money -- spend, I think, more money than any other group in the world actually, in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.
0853	Donald Trump	And I wouldn't be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through -- wouldn't be surprised if it was from these -- some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on because I want -- I don't care.
0854	Donald Trump	I did great.
0855	Donald Trump	I've had a great life.
0856	Donald Trump	I want to get drug prices down.
0857	Donald Trump	I don't care about the companies I want to get drug prices down.
0858	Donald Trump	I want to continue to give them the incentive to come out with new and better answers, but got to get drug prices down.
0859	Donald Trump	And they've made a fortune over the last 40 years.
0860	Donald Trump	They've made so much money.
0861	Donald Trump	And they've got the system wired.
0862	Donald Trump	Because everything you do, their stock goes up.
0863	Donald Trump	I said, "What the hell is going on?
0864	Donald Trump	Their stock just went up."
0865	Donald Trump	They said, "Sir, it's going to be wonderful."
0866	Donald Trump	I said, "It's not going to be wonderful."
0867	Donald Trump	Let their stock go down a little bit.
0868	Donald Trump	But their stock goes up.
0869	Donald Trump	And what we've done is incredible.
0870	Donald Trump	And, by the way, you have some incredible companies.
0871	Donald Trump	The answers that they -- we -- we want to keep them strong and powerful and wealthy, and we want them to con- -- really continue to do that research.
0872	Donald Trump	But we got to get those prices down.
0873	Donald Trump	They're far too high, especially when you compare them to other countries.
0874	Donald Trump	And we want to ensure access to the doctors of your choice.
0875	Donald Trump	And every day, we are going to -- as I said, we are going to defend Medicare like Medicare has never been defended again.
0876	Donald Trump	And it's never needed the defense.
0877	Donald Trump	It's always been incredible.
0878	Donald Trump	It's something that worked and they want to destroy it.
0879	Donald Trump	In my administration, we know that Medicare is personal.
0880	Donald Trump	Great healthcare is about more time with the ones you love, more days with your grandkids, and more freedom to enjoy the most rewarding years of your life -- or what should be, by far, the most rewarding years of your life.
0881	Donald Trump	You've worked hard.
0882	Donald Trump	You've worked so hard.
0883	Donald Trump	And you paid for it.
0884	Donald Trump	And you've got to enjoy it.
0885	Donald Trump	It's about getting better when you're sick, it's improving your well-being, and it's getting the treatment you need, right when you need it.
0886	Donald Trump	That's why, in everything we do, we are defending the principles that made America the envy of the world and the American way of life the greatest in our history.
0887	Donald Trump	And our country has never been greater than it's been right now.
0888	Donald Trump	Our military is the strongest it's ever built -- we rebuilt our entire military.
0889	Donald Trump	And even medical research is at a new level.
0890	Donald Trump	It's at a level that we've never had it before.
0891	Donald Trump	We stand for freedom.
0892	Donald Trump	We stand for choice.
0893	Donald Trump	We stand for justice, and fairness, and accountability.
0894	Donald Trump	We stand for loyalty to our citizens, love for our country, allegiance to our flag, and long and healthy lives for our great seniors.
0895	Donald Trump	And with your help, we are going to continue building the best, most advanced, most cutting-edge healthcare system anywhere in the world.
0896	Donald Trump	We are going to expand our growing economy to make retirement easier, and better, and far more secure.
0897	Donald Trump	We're going to defend American lives, American values, American families, and America's glorious destiny.
0898	Donald Trump	There is no country like our country.
0899	Donald Trump	We see and read things, but there is no country like our country.
0900	Donald Trump	Right?
0901	Donald Trump	With every ounce of strength and every bit of soul, we are going to protect Medicare for you -- for everyone at The Villages, and for every senior across this magnificent land.
0902	Donald Trump	You are going to be protected in many ways -- but you are going to be protected.
0903	Donald Trump	Thank you very being here.
0904	Donald Trump	Thank you for this incredible enthusiasm.
0905	Donald Trump	God bless you.
0906	Donald Trump	God bless our senior citizens.
0907	Donald Trump	And God bless America.
0908	Donald Trump	Thank you very much, everybody.
0909	Donald Trump	Thank you.
0910	Donald Trump	Okay.
0911	Donald Trump	Should I do it?
0912	Donald Trump	I'll do it.
0913	Donald Trump	All right.
0914	Donald Trump	[The executive order is signed]
0915	Donald Trump	Thank you everybody.
0916	Donald Trump	Here -- grab these, fellas.
0917	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
0918	Donald Trump	The congressmen don't want [Inaudible], and I know that.
0919	Donald Trump	Here you go.
0920	Donald Trump	I love that.
0921	Donald Trump	I love that.
0922	Donald Trump	I love those guys.
0923	Donald Trump	Bikers for 45.
0924	Donald Trump	These guys.
0925	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They've been there from the beginning, right?
0926	Donald Trump	Here.
0927	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
0928	Donald Trump	Pass these around, fellas.
0929	Donald Trump	Pass them around.
0930	Donald Trump	Come here.
0931	Donald Trump	Attorney General, get over here.
0932	Donald Trump	Come on.
0933	Donald Trump	Get over here.
0934	Donald Trump	Lieutenant Governor, come on.
0935	Donald Trump	Please, both of you.
0936	Donald Trump	Come on up here.
0937	Donald Trump	They're doing a good job, right?
0938	Donald Trump	Should we give them a pen?
0939	Donald Trump	I think so.
0940	Donald Trump	Come on up here.
0941	Donald Trump	That's great.
0942	Donald Trump	I want to thank you all.
0943	Donald Trump	Really a special time.
0944	Donald Trump	And this is -- this is very meaningful for me and for you and for everybody.
0945	Donald Trump	Thank you all very much.
0946	Donald Trump	Thank you.
