0001	Brian Kilmeade	We are joined right now.
0002	Brian Kilmeade	It is our great pleasure to welcome the president, United States, Donald Trump, calling in.
0003	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
0004	Donald Trump	Good morning.
0005	Brian Kilmeade	Good to have you on Fox and Friends today.
0006	Brian Kilmeade	[Laughs] As you said in your tweet, another slow news week.
0007	Brian Kilmeade	Let's start with the fact that -- the story that Griff just brought us, that it sounds like a former FBI lawyer -- it sounds like -- was doing something with the FISA application.
0008	Brian Kilmeade	That person got removed.
0009	Brian Kilmeade	And this goes to your argument that somebody at the FBI was out to get you, right?
0010	Donald Trump	Well, it certainly does.
0011	Donald Trump	And they were spying on my campaign and it went right up to the top.
0012	Donald Trump	And everybody knows it.
0013	Donald Trump	And now we're going to find out.
0014	Donald Trump	You have Bull Durham, who's supposed to be the toughest.
0015	Donald Trump	I've never met him.
0016	Donald Trump	Never spoke to him.
0017	Donald Trump	But he's supposed to be the smartest and th­­e best.
0018	Donald Trump	And he works for Bill Barr, who is a great attorney general.
0019	Donald Trump	We would have maybe invented this thing a lot sooner had he been there originally.
0020	Donald Trump	But you have some people that are great people, now, and -- patriotic people.
0021	Donald Trump	They love our country.
0022	Donald Trump	This was spying on my campaign, something that has never been done in the history of our country.
0023	Donald Trump	This was an overthrow attempt at the presidency.
0024	Donald Trump	They tried to overthrow the presidency.
0025	Donald Trump	This is a disgrace.
0026	Donald Trump	But what -- I'm not surprised to see; it's just starting to come out.
0027	Donald Trump	I think this is nothing compared that what you'll see over the next couple of weeks.
0028	Ainsley Earhardt	These media --
0029	Donald Trump	These people are sick.
0030	Ainsley Earhardt	These media outlets are saying that the FBI lawyer manipulated and altered key documents related to that warrant application so that they could get permission to surveil Carter Page.
0031	Ainsley Earhardt	He was on with Maria -- Mornings with Maria -- a few minutes ago, and he says it's a cover up.
0032	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen.
0033	Carter Page	[Begin Video Clip] They have just been putting false information out there to the media, the Democrats and their allies in -- they're Washington -- in the media, constantly pushing lies after lies.
0034	Carter Page	And then finally, this gets picked up by a court.
0035	Carter Page	It gets picked up by the Comey-McCabe-FBI.
0036	Carter Page	And they got a warrant, a fraudulent warrant, I believe, to spy on myself as a way of getting into the Trump campaign.
0037	Maria Bartiromo	So, you --
0038	Carter Page	There has been a continued cover up to this very day.
0039	Carter Page	We still don't have the truth, but hopefully we'll get that soon.
0040	Carter Page	[End Video Clip]
0041	Ainsley Earhardt	How does this compare with what happened with that Ukraine conversation?
0042	Ainsley Earhardt	Democrats want to impeach you because of that conversation, but this looks pretty bad.
0043	Donald Trump	So my conversation was a perfect conversation.
0044	Donald Trump	The Ukrainian president said, "What are they talking about?"
0045	Donald Trump	There must think we're nuts in this country.
0046	Donald Trump	And this conversation was flawless.
0047	Donald Trump	It was appropriate.
0048	Donald Trump	It was perfect.
0049	Donald Trump	It was nice.
0050	Donald Trump	It was everything.
0051	Donald Trump	And they even said that.
0052	Donald Trump	They came out and said it.
0053	Donald Trump	Now, compare that -- as they try to impeach, and by the way, they've looked like fools over the last five days, as these interviews were -- these were their witnesses.
0054	Donald Trump	This was the best they've got.
0055	Donald Trump	Adam Schiff is a sick puppy.
0056	Donald Trump	He is a -- it's pretty incredible.
0057	Donald Trump	Now, what you're going to see, I predict, will be perhaps the biggest scandal in the history of our country, political scandal.
0058	Donald Trump	But I guess that's the biggest, because what's more important than a political --?
0059	Steve Doocy	What are you talking -- what do you mean by that?
0060	Steve Doocy	What you mean by that?
0061	Donald Trump	I think you're going to see things that are going to be incredible, if it's done right.
0062	Donald Trump	And I purposely stay out.
0063	Donald Trump	I tell Bill Barr to handle everything.
0064	Donald Trump	I wouldn't have to, I could get very much involved, but I purposely don't.
0065	Donald Trump	And I haven't.
0066	Donald Trump	And you know what?
0067	Donald Trump	It's better that way, I guess.
0068	Donald Trump	I don't have any obligation, legally, to do that, but I've let them handle it.
0069	Donald Trump	So you have a FISA report coming out, which the word is it's "historic."
0070	Donald Trump	That's what the word is.
0071	Donald Trump	That's what I hear.
0072	Donald Trump	And if it's historic, you're going to see something.
0073	Donald Trump	Then perhaps even more importantly, you have Durham coming out shortly thereafter.
0074	Donald Trump	He's the U.S. attorney, and he's already announced it's criminal.
0075	Donald Trump	And we'll see what happens.
0076	Donald Trump	But --
0077	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
0078	Donald Trump	I'll tell you what.
0079	Donald Trump	You have a lot of very, very bad people.
0080	Donald Trump	And, you know, a lot of people say, "deep state."
0081	Donald Trump	I don't like to use the word "deep state."
0082	Donald Trump	So I just say they're really bad and sick people.
0083	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, you say it could be historic.
0084	Brian Kilmeade	You have suggested in the past that this might go much higher than the Department of Justice, or the FBI during the Obama's administration.
0085	Brian Kilmeade	Are you suggesting it could actually go up into the West Wing of the Obama --?
0086	Donald Trump	You're dealing at the highest levels of government.
0087	Donald Trump	They were spying on my campaign.
0088	Donald Trump	This is my opinion.
0089	Donald Trump	I said it a long time ago.
0090	Donald Trump	Remember when I put out a tweet and I talked about the "wiretapping" in quotes, meaning modern day version of whatever wiretapping may be.
0091	Donald Trump	And all hell broke loose.
0092	Brian Kilmeade	Well, how high did it go, Mr. President.
0093	Brian Kilmeade	How high did it go?
0094	Brian Kilmeade	Your idea?
0095	Donald Trump	Personally, I think it goes all the way.
0096	Donald Trump	Okay?
0097	Donald Trump	Because I think it's impossible --
0098	Brian Kilmeade	To Barack Obama?
0099	Brian Kilmeade	-- for Brennan and for Clapper and for all of these losers that you had over there.
0100	Brian Kilmeade	I think it's impossible for them to be doing things.
0101	Brian Kilmeade	And let's see what it all says.
0102	Brian Kilmeade	But it's impossible -- Susan Rice, the person that worked at the United Nations who went after FISA reports and went after reports like she ate them for lunch.
0103	Donald Trump	And, you know, you look at the previous administration that -- they went after like a few.
0104	Donald Trump	And she was getting them by -- at a level nobody's ever even imagined before, and it had nothing to do with her.
0105	Donald Trump	Now, I think this goes to the highest level.
0106	Donald Trump	I hate to say it.
0107	Donald Trump	I think it's a disgrace.
0108	Donald Trump	They thought I was going to win, and they said, "How could we stop him?"
0109	Donald Trump	They wrote up the phony fake dossier, the disgusting fake dossier, and they tried to have it put out prior to the election.
0110	Donald Trump	And just to show how incompetent they were, they spent millions and millions of dollars.
0111	Donald Trump	Hillary Clinton paid for it and the Democrats, a lot of it had to do, they say, with Ukraine.
0112	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
0113	Donald Trump	It's very interesting.
0114	Donald Trump	It's very interesting.
0115	Donald Trump	They have this server right, from the DNC Democratic National Committee.
0116	Brian Kilmeade	Who has the server?
0117	Donald Trump	The FBI went in and they told him, "Get out of here.
0118	Donald Trump	You're not getting it.
0119	Donald Trump	We're not giving it to you."
0120	Donald Trump	They gave the server to Crowd Strike or whatever it's called, which is a company owned by a very wealthy Ukrainian.
0121	Donald Trump	And I still want to see that server.
0122	Donald Trump	You know, the FBI has never gotten that server.
0123	Donald Trump	That's a big part of this whole thing.
0124	Donald Trump	Why did they give it to a Ukrainian company?
0125	Steve Doocy	Are you or they did that?
0126	Steve Doocy	Are you sure they gave it to Ukraine?
0127	Donald Trump	Well, that's what the word is.
0128	Donald Trump	And that's what I asked actually in my phone call, you know.
0129	Donald Trump	I mean, I asked that very point blank because we're looking for corruption.
0130	Donald Trump	There's tremendous corruption we're looking for.
0131	Donald Trump	Why should we be giving hundreds of millions of dollars to countries where there's this kind of corruption?
0132	Donald Trump	Right.
0133	Donald Trump	If you look at my call, I said, you know, corruption -- I think he said it to me.
0134	Donald Trump	He's looking.
0135	Donald Trump	He got elected on the basis of corruption.
0136	Donald Trump	And I also, by the way, going back to that, why isn't Germany putting up money?
0137	Donald Trump	Why isn't France putting up money?
0138	Donald Trump	Why isn't all of the European nations -- why are they putting up?
0139	Donald Trump	You have the European Union and they're benefited in a lot more by --
0140	Brian Kilmeade	Well, yeah.
0141	Donald Trump	-- paying than we are.
0142	Donald Trump	Well, Mr. President, can I ask you --
0143	Donald Trump	It's like a massive wall?
0144	Donald Trump	Yes.
0145	Donald Trump	Why aren't they putting up money?
0146	Donald Trump	How come it's always the United States that puts up money, the suckers?
0147	Donald Trump	Why is it always the United States?
0148	Donald Trump	And these are the questions I ask and continue to ask him.
0149	Brian Kilmeade	True.
0150	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President the best you can.
0151	Brian Kilmeade	I know you've said that from day one about wiretapping.
0152	Brian Kilmeade	And you felt as though the previous administration basically seems to have set you up to really struggle for the first three years.
0153	Brian Kilmeade	Who is your source, or what are your sources that are telling you, that the Obama administration was out to really hurt your administration?
0154	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, Brian, I haven't struggled because I've done more in the first two and a half years than any president in the history of our country.
0155	Donald Trump	And almost everybody admits it.
0156	Donald Trump	Between rebuilding our military, the biggest tax cut in history.
0157	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
0158	Donald Trump	Regulation --
0159	Brian Kilmeade	Would you say they've been in your way?
0160	Brian Kilmeade	Would you say they've been in your way?
0161	Donald Trump	Good.
0162	Donald Trump	Well, wait a second.
0163	Donald Trump	Two Supreme Court justices.
0164	Donald Trump	Within a few weeks, we'll have one hundred and eighty-two federal judges.
0165	Donald Trump	It's a record.
0166	Donald Trump	So I've done more than anybody that ever had.
0167	Brian Kilmeade	Understood.
0168	Donald Trump	The position to [Inaudible] But they haven't made it pleasant.
0169	Donald Trump	They're bad people.
0170	Donald Trump	They hurt a lot of innocent people.
0171	Donald Trump	People came down here, they got served subpoenas by Mueller and the crew.
0172	Donald Trump	And they went through two and a half years.
0173	Donald Trump	They found nothing.
0174	Donald Trump	So why would you say that?
0175	Donald Trump	I think we've had the most productive presidency ever for the first two and a half years.
0176	Donald Trump	But it doesn't mean that it was pleasant.
0177	Brian Kilmeade	I know, I know.
0178	Brian Kilmeade	But maybe I should have been clearer.
0179	Brian Kilmeade	My point is this.
0180	Brian Kilmeade	I know you've had that point of view and some things are coming that direction to prove it.
0181	Brian Kilmeade	But who is your source that's telling you this?
0182	Donald Trump	I can't tell you that.
0183	Donald Trump	I can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened.
0184	Donald Trump	And when you look at Strzok and Page with the insurance policy, where, you know -- the two lovers, the two great lovers from the FBI.
0185	Donald Trump	Where he's saying, "Oh, she's going to win 100 million to nothing, but just in case she loses, we have an insurance policy."
0186	Donald Trump	Well, that means, you know, "We're going to take him down.
0187	Donald Trump	We're going to take down the president."
0188	Donald Trump	You wouldn't even believe this is possible.
0189	Donald Trump	But the insurance policy is a very big find.
0190	Donald Trump	Finding that text.
0191	Donald Trump	And the only reason we found it was they didn't want to use their private servers for a very bad reason.
0192	Donald Trump	Okay?
0193	Donald Trump	So they use the public server.
0194	Donald Trump	They use the FBI server.
0195	Donald Trump	So here's the thing.
0196	Donald Trump	We have so many -- regardless of what's coming out, okay?
0197	Donald Trump	The information that we have now is beyond belief already.
0198	Donald Trump	But what they have coming out, I hear, is historic.
0199	Donald Trump	That's the way it was explained.
0200	Donald Trump	I heard some stories.
0201	Ainsley Earhardt	Coming out and -- All right, Mr. President --
0202	Donald Trump	Of course the fake news will try and downplay it, but I don't think you can downplay this.
0203	Brian Kilmeade	Not now.
0204	Donald Trump	Fake news is part of it.
0205	Donald Trump	You know, the Democrats and the fake news, they're one and the same.
0206	Donald Trump	They will downplay it because I like -- I see these hearings where we have a great day.
0207	Donald Trump	And then you pick up the phony New York Times, which is a total phony paper -- I don't read it anywhere, you can't read it.
0208	Donald Trump	It's not even -- it has no relationship to the truth.
0209	Donald Trump	And you read a story that took place, and they don't tell you what happened.
0210	Donald Trump	They only put in the bad.
0211	Donald Trump	They don't put in the good.
0212	Donald Trump	Same thing with The Washington Post.
0213	Donald Trump	It's a phony paper.
0214	Donald Trump	We don't have it in the White House.
0215	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President, so --
0216	Donald Trump	And we saved a lot of money.
0217	Ainsley Earhardt	-- when we're watching those closing arguments yesterday, Adam Schiff -- Democrats love it.
0218	Ainsley Earhardt	You know, I'm sure he's getting pat on the back every time he walks down the halls in Washington, because people are saying, "Keep pushing, keep pushing.
0219	Ainsley Earhardt	We want impeachment."
0220	Ainsley Earhardt	But if you ask Republicans, and we're going to play a soundbite of his closing arguments, they say this is all theatrics.
0221	Ainsley Earhardt	Watch this and we're going to get your reaction.
0222	Donald Trump	Okay.
0223	Adam Schiff	[Begin Video Clip] It came down to the fact that the day after Bob Mueller testified, the day after Bob Mueller testified, that Donald Trump invited Russian interference.
0224	Adam Schiff	Hey, Russia, if you're listening, come get Hillary's emails.
0225	Adam Schiff	And later that day, they tried to hack her server.
0226	Adam Schiff	The day after that, Donald Trump is back on the phone asking another nation to involve itself in another U.S. election.
0227	Adam Schiff	That says to me, this president believes he is above the law, beyond accountability.
0228	Adam Schiff	[End Video Clip]
0229	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President was there quid pro quo, extortion, bribery?
0230	Donald Trump	No, not at all.
0231	Donald Trump	And let me tell you, he's a sick puppy.
0232	Donald Trump	He's so sick.
0233	Donald Trump	This guy is so -- I’ve been going through it for two and a half years about Russia.
0234	Donald Trump	I've been tougher on Russia than any president in history.
0235	Donald Trump	But for two and a half years, I've had to listen.
0236	Donald Trump	This was their talking point, Trump and Russia.
0237	Donald Trump	And if you take a look at it, just look at the facts.
0238	Donald Trump	Even look at what I've done for Ukraine by giving them tank busters, by giving them stuff.
0239	Donald Trump	And Obama would send pillows and sheets.
0240	Donald Trump	He wouldn't send anything else.
0241	Donald Trump	It's the whole thing.
0242	Donald Trump	Now Schiff, remember this?
0243	Donald Trump	He makes it all up.
0244	Donald Trump	He's sick.
0245	Donald Trump	There's something wrong with him.
0246	Donald Trump	So he made up my phone call.
0247	Donald Trump	He made it up.
0248	Donald Trump	He made up a phone call.
0249	Donald Trump	And then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.
0250	Donald Trump	And crazy Nancy Pelosi, who, by the way, is going to go down as the worst speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, she hasn't done anything.
0251	Donald Trump	Well, she said she's like paralyzed.
0252	Donald Trump	She cannot do anything.
0253	Brian Kilmeade	And Mr. President --
0254	Donald Trump	I predict she won't do USMCA, because Richard Trumka, who's a good guy, but a big union guy -- only cares about a union.
0255	Donald Trump	Richard Trumka has her mortified.
0256	Donald Trump	She won't do USMCA and everybody in the country wants it, the farmers, the manufacturers.
0257	Donald Trump	But Richard Trumka has her -- like he plays her like a fiddle.
0258	Donald Trump	And I predict you won't even do it.
0259	Donald Trump	She -- and, by the way, she's got such pressure on her to do it.
0260	Donald Trump	All she has to do is put it to a vote.
0261	Donald Trump	She's holding it for six months.
0262	Donald Trump	It's growing dust on her desk, and Mexico and Canada calling, saying, "What's going on?
0263	Donald Trump	Where is our agreement?"
0264	Donald Trump	They signed it.
0265	Donald Trump	They're all set.
0266	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, a couple of days ago, your ambassador to the United -- to the E.U., Mr. Sondland, in his opening statement said that there was quid pro quo.
0267	Brian Kilmeade	There was quid pro quo, he said because you wanted an investigation into corruption, in exchange for a visit to the White House or something like that.
0268	Donald Trump	Yeah, well, that's total nonsense.
0269	Donald Trump	I do want -- always corruption.
0270	Donald Trump	I say that to anybody.
0271	Donald Trump	Why should we give money to a country that's known corrupt?
0272	Donald Trump	It's a very corrupt country.
0273	Donald Trump	I mean, I love the people in Ukraine.
0274	Donald Trump	I know Ukrainian people.
0275	Donald Trump	They're great people.
0276	Donald Trump	But it's known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.
0277	Donald Trump	Now, with this guy who, by the way, I hardly know him.
0278	Donald Trump	Okay?
0279	Brian Kilmeade	Sondland?
0280	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0281	Donald Trump	I've spoken to him a few times.
0282	Donald Trump	How about the guy with the telephone?
0283	Donald Trump	How about that one?
0284	Donald Trump	I guarantee you that never took place.
0285	Donald Trump	He said he's sitting there listening to me.
0286	Donald Trump	I spoke so few times to him.
0287	Donald Trump	But the guy yesterday on the telephone, David Holmes, "Yes, I heard the conversation."
0288	Donald Trump	Well, I have really good hearing.
0289	Donald Trump	And I've been watching guys for 40 years make phone calls.
0290	Donald Trump	And I can't hear when -- you could be two feet away; I can't hear people making calls.
0291	Donald Trump	I can't hear the other side, the phones up in the air.
0292	Donald Trump	Unless you have it on the speaker phone, you can't do it.
0293	Donald Trump	That was a total phony deal.
0294	Donald Trump	That was a phone -- you know, again.
0295	Donald Trump	Call it Deep State.
0296	Donald Trump	Call it --
0297	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
0298	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
0299	Donald Trump	Call it anti-Trump people.
0300	Brian Kilmeade	Your ambassador said that there was quid pro quo because you wanted an investigation into corruption, but it involved Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.
0301	Brian Kilmeade	And then it becomes like, look, "He's going after dirt on the Bidens because Joe Biden could be his opponent in 2020."
0302	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, that's not true.
0303	Donald Trump	Okay.
0304	Donald Trump	Number one, it's absolutely not true.
0305	Donald Trump	Now, then, you have to say, if you saw Joe Biden's --
0306	Brian Kilmeade	Which part is not true?
0307	Donald Trump	Joe Biden is corrupt.
0308	Donald Trump	It's not true what he said.
0309	Donald Trump	Now, what he said, also, is, "There was no quid pro quo.
0310	Donald Trump	I want nothing."
0311	Donald Trump	Remember was trending number one.
0312	Donald Trump	I want nothing.
0313	Donald Trump	He said that when he was questioned.
0314	Brian Kilmeade	He did.
0315	Donald Trump	He, and by the way, check out his lawyers, they're Hillary Clinton lawyers.
0316	Donald Trump	This guy has Hillary Clinton, the lawyers, their Democrats.
0317	Brian Kilmeade	Sondland.
0318	Donald Trump	But he's sitting there -- Sondland.
0319	Donald Trump	Yes.
0320	Donald Trump	He's sitting there with Clinton lawyers.
0321	Donald Trump	They're passing him notes all the time.
0322	Donald Trump	And he didn't put the most important phrase in his 22-page statement that he read.
0323	Donald Trump	The most important phrase was, "I want nothing" -- twice I said it -- "I want nothing.
0324	Donald Trump	I want nothing.
0325	Donald Trump	I want no quid pro quo.
0326	Donald Trump	Have President Zelensky do whatever is right."
0327	Donald Trump	Something to that effect.
0328	Donald Trump	And they didn't put that in.
0329	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
0330	Donald Trump	That was the end of him.
0331	Donald Trump	I turned off the television.
0332	Donald Trump	That's what he said.
0333	Donald Trump	Now, with all of that, of course, you have to look at corruption.
0334	Donald Trump	Are we going to be sending massive amounts of money to a country, and they're corrupt, and they steal the money, and it goes into everybody's bank accounts?
0335	Donald Trump	So you have to look at that.
0336	Donald Trump	And I will tell you this about Joe Biden.
0337	Donald Trump	I never said it specifically on him.
0338	Donald Trump	But I watched Joe Biden with the prosecutor, who a lot of people said was a great prosecutor, and they took him off.
0339	Donald Trump	And he was prosecuting that company.
0340	Donald Trump	And the kid who'd never made 10 cents in his life and all of a sudden is making millions of dollars a day, I mean, you tell me.
0341	Donald Trump	This is a guy who got thrown out of the Navy dishonorably --
0342	Brian Kilmeade	But --
0343	Donald Trump	He gets thrown out of the Navy shortly thereafter and makes no money.
0344	Donald Trump	Went through, made no money --
0345	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
0346	Donald Trump	And all of the sudden --
0347	Brian Kilmeade	No, I hear you.
0348	Donald Trump	-- becomes VP is making millions and millions of dollars, not only from there, but from China.
0349	Donald Trump	[Crosstalk]
0350	Donald Trump	So, Mr. President, the accusation is this, that you're using aid, taxpayer dollars, to attack a political opponent in Joe Biden.
0351	Donald Trump	And you say, you do say, "I wanted to hold up that aid because of corruption," but you also have the phone calls --
0352	Donald Trump	No, no.
0353	Donald Trump	Two reasons.
0354	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
0355	Donald Trump	For corruption because it's known.
0356	Donald Trump	I want to make sure the money is going to be spent properly.
0357	Donald Trump	But there's another reason that is maybe to me the most important.
0358	Brian Kilmeade	Which is?
0359	Donald Trump	Why isn't Germany, France, the European Union, why aren't all those countries in Europe, why aren't they paying?
0360	Donald Trump	Why is it always the United States, the sucker?
0361	Donald Trump	I got elected on that.
0362	Brian Kilmeade	But they do give aid.
0363	Donald Trump	They --
0364	Brian Kilmeade	They do give aid.
0365	Brian Kilmeade	We give more.
0366	Brian Kilmeade	We always have.
0367	Brian Kilmeade	But, Mr. President, you decide to say Rudy Giuliani, a longtime friend, mayor and prosecutor, you send him into the Ukraine.
0368	Brian Kilmeade	I want you to hear with Ambassador Sondland said, and it's been pretty consistent among State Department workers.
0369	Brian Kilmeade	It seems like Rudy Giuliani was getting under a lot of people's skin.
0370	Brian Kilmeade	I want you to listen to what he said.
0371	Donald Trump	Through the --
0372	Brian Kilmeade	I want you here.
0373	Brian Kilmeade	Listen.
0374	Brian Kilmeade	I've known for a long time, too.
0375	Brian Kilmeade	Let's listen.
0376	Gordon Sondland	[Begin Video Clip] Secretary Perry, Ambassador Volker, and I worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president of the United States.
0377	Gordon Sondland	We did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani.
0378	Gordon Sondland	We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.
0379	Gordon Sondland	[End Video Clip]
0380	Brian Kilmeade	So why was it necessary to put Rudy in the middle of the Ukraine, a country he knew little about, as opposed to let the people do their jobs there and just give given the same mission?
0381	Donald Trump	Okay.
0382	Donald Trump	First of all, Volker, I don't know him.
0383	Donald Trump	Don't know him.
0384	Donald Trump	But this guy, Sondland, hardly know him.
0385	Donald Trump	I've had a couple of conversations with him.
0386	Donald Trump	I see him hanging around, you know, when I go to Europe.
0387	Donald Trump	But he was really the European Union ambassador, and all of a sudden he's working on this, and, you know, ask about that.
0388	Donald Trump	Rick Perry, I know very well.
0389	Donald Trump	Frankly, I'd like Rick to make a statement, and Rick would make a statement.
0390	Donald Trump	He's a great guy.
0391	Donald Trump	I think he already made a statement.
0392	Donald Trump	Great guy.
0393	Donald Trump	Rudy is a great crime fighter.
0394	Donald Trump	Rudy is the best mayor in the history of New York City.
0395	Donald Trump	Rudy Giuliani is a very legendary figure in our country.
0396	Donald Trump	Rudy was a U.S. attorney.
0397	Donald Trump	He also worked at the Justice Department.
0398	Donald Trump	Believe me, this kind of crap wouldn't have happened in the Justice Department if Rudy Giuliani was the attorney general, just like I believe Bill Barr will straighten it out and straighten it out for good.
0399	Donald Trump	But Rudy Giuliani was one of the great crime fighters of all time.
0400	Donald Trump	He's also a friend of mine.
0401	Donald Trump	He's a great person.
0402	Donald Trump	He's like an iconic figure in this country for two reasons.
0403	Donald Trump	He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York, and he was the greatest crime fighter, probably, in the last 50 years.
0404	Donald Trump	When you're dealing with a corrupt country, if Rudy Giuliani's -- he's got credentials because of his reputation.
0405	Donald Trump	When Rudy Giuliani goes there, and you hear it's a corrupt country, I mean, it means a lot.
0406	Donald Trump	It's mean a lot.
0407	Donald Trump	But two of his sources are indicted on -- are right now in jail.
0408	Donald Trump	Those are two of his sources, and one of his other sources is looked at as a corrupt figure.
0409	Donald Trump	So in the end, it seems like you had this.
0410	Donald Trump	You had State Department and Rudy Giuliani working against each other.
0411	Donald Trump	And then the accusation comes in that your ambassador is being tarnished by Rudy Giuliani.
0412	Donald Trump	Look, the ambassador, the woman, she wouldn't even put up -- she's an Obama person, you know.
0413	Donald Trump	But I said, "Why are you being so kind?"
0414	Donald Trump	Well, sir, she's a woman.
0415	Donald Trump	We have to be nice.
0416	Donald Trump	She's very tough.
0417	Donald Trump	I've heard bad things.
0418	Donald Trump	And by the way, when I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone.
0419	Donald Trump	You can read it.
0420	Donald Trump	He didn't like her.
0421	Donald Trump	He brought up her name, and he didn't like her at all.
0422	Donald Trump	How do you have an ambassador when the president, the new president, does not?
0423	Donald Trump	Because she was so wedded in.
0424	Donald Trump	And don't forget, Ukraine hated me.
0425	Donald Trump	They were after me in the election.
0426	Donald Trump	They wanted Hillary Clinton to win.
0427	Donald Trump	And when I won, all of a sudden they became so nice.
0428	Donald Trump	They were doing -- they had to make up -- there many articles where they had to, you know, get to be friendly, you know, because we're like a gravy train for them, okay?
0429	Donald Trump	We're like their gravy train.
0430	Donald Trump	So they were totally in favor of Hillary Clinton.
0431	Donald Trump	But this ambassador that, you know, everybody says is so wonderful?
0432	Donald Trump	She wouldn't hang my picture in the embassy.
0433	Donald Trump	Okay?
0434	Donald Trump	She's in charge of the embassy.
0435	Donald Trump	She wouldn't hang it.
0436	Donald Trump	It took like a year and a half or two years for her to get the picture up.
0437	Donald Trump	She said bad things about me.
0438	Donald Trump	She wouldn't defend me.
0439	Donald Trump	And I have the right to change an Ambassador.
0440	Donald Trump	And Rudy didn't say good things, but he wasn't crazy about it.
0441	Donald Trump	You know, it wasn't like a major topic.
0442	Donald Trump	But I have the right to change.
0443	Donald Trump	This was an Obama person -- didn't want to hang my picture in the embassy.
0444	Donald Trump	Standard is you put the president of the United States pictured at an embassy.
0445	Donald Trump	This was not an angel, this woman, okay?
0446	Donald Trump	And there are a lot of things that she did that I didn't like.
0447	Donald Trump	And we will talk about that at some time.
0448	Donald Trump	But I just want to let you know, this was not a baby that we're dealing with.
0449	Ainsley Earhardt	There was one woman who was in all of these testimonies this week who was sticking up for you, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.
0450	Ainsley Earhardt	She was asking questions, doing her job.
0451	Ainsley Earhardt	She said her constituents want to get to the bottom of what happened with the Bidens and that investigation.
0452	Ainsley Earhardt	She questioned Tim Morrison and Kurt Volker on Capitol Hill.
0453	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen to this.
0454	Donald Trump	Okay.
0455	Elise Stefanik	[Begin Video Clip] But the truth is, the facts are indeed not complicated.
0456	Elise Stefanik	And I'm going to close out with two questions for the both of you.
0457	Elise Stefanik	Did Ukraine open investigation into the Biden's?
0458	Elise Stefanik	Mr. Morrison.
0459	Tim Morrison	Not to my knowledge, ma'am.
0460	Elise Stefanik	Ambassador Volker.
0461	Kurt Volker	Not to my knowledge, either.
0462	Elise Stefanik	Did either of you ever have any evidence of quid pro quo?
0463	Elise Stefanik	Mr. Morrison.
0464	Tim Morrison	No, ma'am.
0465	Elise Stefanik	Ambassador Volker.
0466	Kurt Volker	I did not.
0467	Elise Stefanik	Any evidence of bribery?
0468	Tim Morrison	No, ma'am.
0469	Kurt Volker	No, ma'am.
0470	Kurt Volker	[End Video Clip]
0471	Ainsley Earhardt	She's been racked over the coals for that.
0472	Ainsley Earhardt	Kellyanne Conway's husband was one of the ones that called her trash.
0473	Donald Trump	So I'll tell you, first of all, she's become a star.
0474	Donald Trump	You know, every time you do something, you have guys like Jim Jordan and Meadows, or all these guys, they've been around and they're stars, but they've been stars.
0475	Donald Trump	Every once in a while you meet a new star.
0476	Donald Trump	I know a lot about stardom.
0477	Donald Trump	I know a lot about it.
0478	Donald Trump	I've made plenty of them.
0479	Donald Trump	But I'll tell you what, this young woman from upstate New York, she has become a star.
0480	Donald Trump	Her way -- you know, you can never define exactly what it is.
0481	Donald Trump	You understand that you're a star.
0482	Donald Trump	Okay?
0483	Donald Trump	Why?
0484	Donald Trump	Who the hell knows?
0485	Donald Trump	But you're a star.
0486	Donald Trump	There aren't many of them.
0487	Donald Trump	But what happens is she has become a star.
0488	Donald Trump	Her mannerism, her way of talking, her --
0489	Brian Kilmeade	She's direct.
0490	Brian Kilmeade	Right to the point.
0491	Donald Trump	No.
0492	Donald Trump	It's just the whole thing.
0493	Donald Trump	It just works.
0494	Donald Trump	She's a tremendous person.
0495	Donald Trump	She was fantastic during the hearings.
0496	Donald Trump	Turner, every -- so many people there were so great.
0497	Donald Trump	But you know what?
0498	Donald Trump	The bottom line is all of those witnesses, they're all shifty Schiff, don't forget.
0499	Donald Trump	There was no due process.
0500	Donald Trump	You can't have lawyers.
0501	Donald Trump	We couldn't have any witnesses.
0502	Donald Trump	We want to call the whistleblower.
0503	Donald Trump	But, you know, who I want as the first witness?
0504	Donald Trump	Because, frankly, I want a trial.
0505	Donald Trump	You know, I could -- think I can have it.
0506	Brian Kilmeade	You want to a trial?
0507	Donald Trump	Oh, I would look -- number one.
0508	Donald Trump	They should never, ever impeach.
0509	Donald Trump	This is not envy.
0510	Donald Trump	I watched five people on your network yesterday say there's nothing here.
0511	Donald Trump	Andy McCarthy.
0512	Donald Trump	How about Kent and the special prosecutor?
0513	Brian Kilmeade	Ken Starr?
0514	Donald Trump	And special counsel, Ken Starr?
0515	Donald Trump	He was fantastic.
0516	Donald Trump	He said, "There's nothing here."
0517	Donald Trump	So ready?
0518	Donald Trump	Number one, there should never be an impeachment.
0519	Donald Trump	This is not an impeachment.
0520	Donald Trump	That phone call was totally appropriate.
0521	Donald Trump	Okay.
0522	Donald Trump	Totally.
0523	Donald Trump	But assuming these people are as sleazy as they are, and Nancy Pelosi is totally incompetent, she's lost absolutely lost -- she doesn't know what she's doing.
0524	Donald Trump	She hasn't done anything.
0525	Donald Trump	She can't get anything approved.
0526	Donald Trump	Everybody's working on this, and they just got blown away because they put their witnesses up.
0527	Donald Trump	And we're not going to get USMCA --
0528	Brian Kilmeade	So you want a trial?
0529	Donald Trump	-- farmers and everyone is going to vote against Democrats like you've never seen before.
0530	Donald Trump	But if they do put it up, because they're crazy, I mean, Adam Schiff is a nut job.
0531	Donald Trump	Listen to this.
0532	Donald Trump	Adam Schiff gets up before Congress and he made up my statement.
0533	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0534	Donald Trump	And I said, "Who made that statement?
0535	Donald Trump	.
536	Brian Kilmeade	Right, Mr. President?
537	Donald Trump	He made it up.
538	Donald Trump	And then after he got caught three days later, he started saying parody.
539	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President?
540	Donald Trump	The thing I did that was right, Brian, the thing I did that was right was I released the transcript of the call immediately.
541	Donald Trump	Had I not done that; I would have had a big problem.
542	Donald Trump	A big problem because they all lied about my call.
543	Donald Trump	My call was perfect.
544	Donald Trump	If you heard Adam Schiff's made up version of my call, I mean, it was the worst thing I've ever heard.
545	Donald Trump	I said, How could that be possible?"
0546	Donald Trump	And you know the sad part?
0547	Donald Trump	Because he made it in the halls of Congress, he has immunity.
0548	Donald Trump	I can't sue him.
0549	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0550	Donald Trump	The Republican Party can't sue him.
0551	Donald Trump	Now, one other thing before we get off the Republican Party --
0552	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
0553	Donald Trump	I know.
0554	Donald Trump	We can keep this going all day, right?
0555	Donald Trump	It's easy.
0556	Donald Trump	But look, the Republican Party has never been more unified.
0557	Donald Trump	Both the Senate and the House.
0558	Donald Trump	Mitch, Lindsey, I could name 20 names up there.
0559	Donald Trump	I could -- they have never had -- look, we won 196 to nothing.
0560	Donald Trump	That never happens.
0561	Donald Trump	You know, I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians to have lousy policy, but they stick together, and they're vicious.
0562	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0563	Brian Kilmeade	Well --
0564	Donald Trump	They're more vicious, frankly.
0565	Donald Trump	But the Republicans, they have a tendency -- they break up.
0566	Donald Trump	They don't -- the Republicans, I have never seen anything like --
0567	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President.
0568	Donald Trump	They're sticking together.
0569	Brian Kilmeade	We understand that there were six Republican senators -- this is perfect transition into this question -- who talked to you yesterday --
0570	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0571	Brian Kilmeade	-- along with the White House lawyer.
0572	Brian Kilmeade	I know Jared Kushner was there.
0573	Brian Kilmeade	You're trying to figure out some sort of strategy going forward because --
0574	Donald Trump	Yeah.
0575	Brian Kilmeade	-- it does look as if Nancy Pelosi, you know, her back is up against the wall.
0576	Brian Kilmeade	She's going to have to go ahead and proceed with the impeachment vote.
0577	Brian Kilmeade	It's going to wind up in the Senate.
0578	Brian Kilmeade	And you say that you -- to your earlier point -- you want a full trial because then you will wind up with, according to this story, due process, which you feel you did not get with Adam Schiff.
0579	Brian Kilmeade	Which means you can call your own witnesses, and you would love to see Hunter Biden in the chair to answer all those questions about Ukraine.
0580	Donald Trump	Well, there's only one person I want more than where's Hunter?
0581	Donald Trump	And that is Adam Schiff.
0582	Donald Trump	I want to put that guy with his, with his way.
0583	Donald Trump	I want…
0584	Brian Kilmeade	What's your first question for Adam Schiff?
0585	Donald Trump	I almost said something that might have been slightly controversial.
0586	Steve Doocy	Yes.
0587	Donald Trump	But I didn't.
0588	Donald Trump	I'm learning.
0589	Donald Trump	See that Steve?
0590	Donald Trump	I'm learning.
0591	Donald Trump	But after all these years, I finally learned.
0592	Donald Trump	But look, I want to see Adam Schiff testify about the whistleblower who is a fake whistleblower, because the whistleblower report was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine.
0593	Donald Trump	It bored no relationship.
0594	Donald Trump	It said there were eight, seven or eight, quid pro quos.
0595	Donald Trump	That were none.
0596	Donald Trump	It bore no relationship to my call.
0597	Donald Trump	Nobody brings that out.
0598	Donald Trump	The whistle blower is, in my opinion, a political operative, just like his lawyer, who is one of the worst people in Washington.
0599	Steve Doocy	Do you think you know who it is?
0600	Donald Trump	I know exactly who it is.
0601	Donald Trump	Everybody does.
0602	Steve Doocy	Is he still there?
0603	Steve Doocy	Does he go to meetings --
0604	Donald Trump	Everybody does --
0605	Steve Doocy	-- does he go to meetings?
0606	Donald Trump	And by the way, you know who the whistleblower is, too.
0607	Donald Trump	Otherwise, you're not doing your job.
0608	Donald Trump	You know the -- everybody knows it.
0609	Donald Trump	If the whistleblower were on the other side, they would have revealed the whistleblower two months ago.
0610	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President.
0611	Donald Trump	But the Democrats and their machine, the media machine, the fake, corrupt media, they protect.
0612	Donald Trump	But you know who the whistleblower is.
0613	Donald Trump	So do I. I know it.
0614	Donald Trump	But I want the whistleblower who put in a false report to testify.
0615	Donald Trump	I want to know, why did the IG put in the report?
0616	Donald Trump	You have an IG, right?
0617	Donald Trump	Why did the IG instead of saying, "Let me take the report.
0618	Donald Trump	Let me now go to the White House.
0619	Donald Trump	Ask the president to declassify his conversation so that it has to match up."
0620	Donald Trump	He didn't do that.
0621	Donald Trump	So what you do is you have a whistleblower with a fake story, just like -- it's just as fake as Schiff's story.
0622	Donald Trump	That's why a lot of people think that Schiff basically is, essentially, the whistleblower.
0623	Donald Trump	He already told the whistle blower what to do.
0624	Donald Trump	I mean, his whole story is that he doesn't know the whistleblower.
0625	Donald Trump	If he doesn't, then he's the only person in Washington that doesn't.
0626	Donald Trump	And it's already been acknowledged that his staff met with the whistleblower.
0627	Donald Trump	Okay, it is probably more than --
0628	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
0629	Brian Kilmeade	Go ahead.
0630	Donald Trump	Who I what to testify most is shifty Schiff.
0631	Donald Trump	And I want to find out, why did he make up my statement?
0632	Donald Trump	He made up my statement, and I want to find that out.
0633	Donald Trump	Why did shifty Schiff, who's a crooked politician, he's a corrupt politician, why did he make up my statement?
0634	Donald Trump	He made up a statement.
0635	Donald Trump	And I'm listen to it --
0636	Ainsley Earhardt	Because they didn't think you were going to release the transcript.
0637	Donald Trump	No, no, he -- that's right.
0638	Donald Trump	Exactly.
0639	Donald Trump	Because where this whole thing fell apart and where, frankly, the Republicans became so incredibly unified is after they read my statement --
0640	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0641	Ainsley Earhardt	Mr. President.
0642	Donald Trump	-- every one of them said -- and only the ones that are a little off on my statement are the people, that haven't quite read it yet.
0643	Donald Trump	To say, "Well, this isn't an impeachable -- [Crosstalk]
0644	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, if you read it, Democrats are going to say it was quid pro quo.
0645	Ainsley Earhardt	If you are a conservative, you're going to say --
0646	Donald Trump	No.
0647	Donald Trump	They can't.
0648	Donald Trump	They can't.
0649	Ainsley Earhardt	Well, they're saying that it was.
0650	Ainsley Earhardt	They believe in a roundabout way that it was.
0651	Ainsley Earhardt	[Crosstalk]
0652	Donald Trump	Well, Adam Schiff says what I said, too, and it was totally different.
0653	Ainsley Earhardt	But the bottom line is, is this an impeachable offense?
0654	Ainsley Earhardt	Did you do anything that they can impeach you for?
0655	Donald Trump	There's nothing there.
0656	Donald Trump	In fact, they asked these terrible witnesses yesterday.
0657	Donald Trump	Again, I don't even know these people.
0658	Donald Trump	You know, I come to Washington.
0659	Donald Trump	So you've had Bush and you have never-Trumpers.
0660	Donald Trump	So you have Bush.
0661	Donald Trump	You have Clinton.
0662	Donald Trump	You have Obama.
0663	Donald Trump	So you have 24 years of people in positions, right?
0664	Donald Trump	Then I come in with no experience, which is a good thing.
0665	Donald Trump	But I know life, and I come in, and I end up with thousands of people that are never-Trumpers, Clinton's people, and sometimes the never-Trumpers are worse than Clinton and Obama people, believe me.
0666	Donald Trump	You know, I mean, it's an amazing phenomena.
0667	Brian Kilmeade	But that's one thing -- President Obama released every --
0668	Donald Trump	Okay, Brian?
0669	Brian Kilmeade	Yes?
0670	Donald Trump	Well, listen to this for a second.
0671	Donald Trump	With no experience at doing this -- but I've had a lot of experience in life.
0672	Donald Trump	And we're doing great as a country and we’re respected again as a country, we were not respected -- with no experience, I come to Washington.
0673	Donald Trump	I've defeated the Clinton dynasty.
0674	Donald Trump	I've defeated the Bush dynasty, and I've defeated the Obama whatever you want to call it.
0675	Donald Trump	Right?
0676	Donald Trump	The three biggest.
0677	Donald Trump	I've defeated them all at one time with no experience.
0678	Donald Trump	The hatred is incredible.
0679	Donald Trump	But I have to deal with crazy Nancy.
0680	Donald Trump	I mean, she's crazy as a bedbug.
0681	Donald Trump	She is nuts.
0682	Donald Trump	And what she's doing -- and she's not talented.
0683	Donald Trump	She's highly overrated -- all she's doing is sitting.
0684	Donald Trump	She's not doing any work for the people.
0685	Donald Trump	And now it turns out that the whole impeachment thing is a scam.
0686	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
0687	Brian Kilmeade	Gotcha.
0688	Brian Kilmeade	So --
0689	Donald Trump	And now on top of it, now you're starting to get some feedback that the IG report is coming out.
0690	Donald Trump	And I think that will be --
0691	Brian Kilmeade	Explosive.
0692	Donald Trump	-- the greatest political scandal in the history of our country.
0693	Brian Kilmeade	If we could -- now let's switch.
0694	Brian Kilmeade	And let's talk a little bit about 2020.
0695	Steve Doocy	Well, I'd like -- well, let me just interrupt for a second.
0696	Steve Doocy	Mr. President, you said we know the name of the whistleblower.
0697	Steve Doocy	We've seen names on the Internet.
0698	Steve Doocy	We have no idea who the whistleblower is.
0699	Brian Kilmeade	Right.
0700	Donald Trump	No.
0701	Donald Trump	I don't believe it.
0702	Donald Trump	Steve, can I tell you -- [Crosstalk]
0703	Steve Doocy	But it's -- all right.
0704	Donald Trump	I don't think Steve has ever told a lie, Ainsley and Brian, in his life.
0705	Donald Trump	But that one I'm sort of thinking.
0706	Donald Trump	All right.
0707	Donald Trump	Come on.
0708	Brian Kilmeade	So you expect to --
0709	Donald Trump	And I'm always telling people I watch your show in the morning.
0710	Donald Trump	I don't watch the garbage.
0711	Donald Trump	The other garbage.
0712	Steve Doocy	We've seen names online, Mr. President.
0713	Steve Doocy	But we don't have any verification.
0714	Brian Kilmeade	Yeah, and it doesn't matter.
0715	Brian Kilmeade	It doesn't matter anyway.
0716	Brian Kilmeade	We're not going to use it.
0717	Donald Trump	You don't need verification.
0718	Donald Trump	You know exactly who it is.
0719	Donald Trump	But I like that you say that.
0720	Brian Kilmeade	So, Mr. President, you expect an impeachment vote, you expect to get impeached and would you say you said you embrace the idea --
0721	Donald Trump	No, I don't expect it.
0722	Brian Kilmeade	You don't expect it?
0723	Brian Kilmeade	You don't expect Democrats are going to vote for this?
0724	Donald Trump	I think it's very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.
0725	Donald Trump	No, I would expect that -- okay.
0726	Donald Trump	Ready?
0727	Donald Trump	You've seen the polls over the last week.
0728	Donald Trump	I'm going through the roof.
0729	Donald Trump	In Wisconsin, I'm way up over every Democrat.
0730	Brian Kilmeade	You are.
0731	Donald Trump	The swing states, which is the important one.
0732	Donald Trump	You know, you have two elections.
0733	Donald Trump	You have Electoral College, you have popularity.
0734	Donald Trump	I like to go for the Electoral College.
0735	Donald Trump	By the way, for me to win the popular vote would be much easier than -- the Electoral College is much harder to win.
0736	Donald Trump	Much harder.
0737	Donald Trump	You have to go to many more places, etc., etc.
0738	Donald Trump	But if you look at the swing states, I'm way up at every one of them because of the impeachment thing.
0739	Donald Trump	And it's crazy what's going on.
0740	Donald Trump	Because the people get it.
0741	Donald Trump	It's a hoax.
0742	Donald Trump	This is a continuation of the witch hunt which has gone on from before I got elected.
0743	Ainsley Earhardt	Well --
0744	Donald Trump	If you look at the -- you know, we talked about the insurance policy.
0745	Donald Trump	Right.
0746	Donald Trump	You know, "We've got an insurance policy just in case she loses."
0747	Donald Trump	Right?
0748	Donald Trump	This was a text between the two great lovers.
0749	Donald Trump	If you look at that, that was long before the election took place.
0750	Donald Trump	So this was taking, you know, route -- with Comey, who's a totally disgusting human being -- by the way, and if I didn't fire Comey, I would have been in some trouble right now.
0751	Brian Kilmeade	And maybe you should have done it right away.
0752	Brian Kilmeade	But Mr. President --
0753	Donald Trump	All coming after me, and I wouldn't have known that he was a phony that Strzok and Page in all of these people.
0754	Donald Trump	McCabe.
0755	Donald Trump	The whole gang of them.
0756	Donald Trump	We wouldn't have been able to find it out.
0757	Donald Trump	Turned out to be the best move I've ever made, firing Comey.
0758	Donald Trump	Because they were looking to take down the president of the United States.
0759	Brian Kilmeade	He doesn't agree.
0760	Brian Kilmeade	John Bolton has just gone back on Twitter.
0761	Brian Kilmeade	His account was frozen for two months.
0762	Brian Kilmeade	Did you guys freeze his account?
0763	Donald Trump	No, of course not.
0764	Donald Trump	Of course not.
0765	Donald Trump	No, I actually had a good relationship with John.
0766	Donald Trump	We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship.
0767	Ainsley Earhardt	All right, Mr. President.
0768	Ainsley Earhardt	Let's talk about --
0769	Donald Trump	I didn't hear about that.
0770	Ainsley Earhardt	Let's talk about 2020, because we saw the last Democratic debate, and the ratings were really low.
0771	Ainsley Earhardt	I don't know if that's an indication that it's too early or if people are not interested in these candidates.
0772	Ainsley Earhardt	And maybe that's why some of these other guys are talking about jumping into the race.
0773	Ainsley Earhardt	Elizabeth Warren says she's going to use tax dollars to take down your border wall.
0774	Ainsley Earhardt	Listen to this.
0775	Unidentified	[Begin Video Clip] Would you ask taxpayers to pay to take down any part of the wall on the nation's southern border?
0776	Elizabeth Warren	If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it.
0777	Elizabeth Warren	The real point here is that we need to stop this manmade crisis at the border.
0778	Elizabeth Warren	Trump is the one who has created this crisis.
0779	Elizabeth Warren	[End Video Clip]
0780	Ainsley Earhardt	Tom Honan said the reason that the numbers are down is because of the wall.
0781	Ainsley Earhardt	What do you say?
0782	Donald Trump	Absolutely.
0783	Donald Trump	We've built almost 100 miles of wall.
0784	Donald Trump	It's going up fast.
0785	Donald Trump	Army Corps of Engineers is doing it.
0786	Donald Trump	We have the funding.
0787	Donald Trump	I took it out of the military.
0788	Donald Trump	You know, I've rebuilt the military.
0789	Donald Trump	That's another thing we've done, which was, when I took it over -- and we defeated ISIS.
0790	Donald Trump	We took the caliphate.
0791	Donald Trump	We just took out al-Baghdadi.
0792	Donald Trump	I got you know; I don't want it.
0793	Donald Trump	I don't want it, frankly.
0794	Donald Trump	But if Obama did al-Baghdadi, the biggest terrorist the last hundred year, if Obama did it, it would be a two-year story.
0795	Donald Trump	With me, I got a day.
0796	Donald Trump	Not that it matters, but it was a tremendous thing.
0797	Donald Trump	We defeated him.
0798	Donald Trump	But let me just tell you about the wall.
0799	Donald Trump	Without the wall -- and Tom Homan's a great guy -- without the wall, it would be a disaster.
0800	Brian Kilmeade	Absolutely.
0801	Donald Trump	So and if she took down the wall -- you need the wall.
0802	Donald Trump	You know, they want to have drones flying around up and down, and, you know, this and that.
0803	Donald Trump	It's all just a waste of money.
0804	Donald Trump	Other than -- we have drones flying to see if anybody is trying to break through the wall.
0805	Donald Trump	Because if you have a bulldozer or if you have heavy blow torches and things, you know, you can break through.
0806	Donald Trump	We have -- the wall is electrified, so that if anyone touches it, we know exactly what's happening.
0807	Donald Trump	We can get there within minutes.
0808	Steve Doocy	Sure.
0809	Steve Doocy	You were elected to -- [Crosstalk]
0810	Donald Trump	Now, we're building a fantastic wall, and without the wall now -- it just means she's going to lose.
0811	Donald Trump	Because one of the issues that I won on last time was border security.
0812	Donald Trump	And you see where the numbers are.
0813	Donald Trump	Now, until I got the wall built, I got Mexico -- because we're not allowed -- very simply, we have loopholes.
0814	Donald Trump	And they call loopholes for a reason, because there are loopholes.
0815	Donald Trump	I could end those loopholes in 15 minutes with crazy Nancy Pelosi and Schumer.
0816	Donald Trump	I could end them in 15 minutes.
0817	Donald Trump	But they don't want to meet about them because they like trouble, because the more trouble we have -- they don't care about the country.
0818	Donald Trump	The more trouble they have, the better it is for them, they think the worse it is for me.
0819	Donald Trump	So I got the war built despite them fighting me.
0820	Donald Trump	I got so much money for them, for the military.
0821	Donald Trump	It's the one thing that wouldn't give you money for the wall because they thought that was a very good thing politically.
0822	Donald Trump	If you don't have a wall, we don't have a country.
0823	Donald Trump	If we don't have a border, we don't have a country.
0824	Brian Kilmeade	Mr. President, right now.
0825	Brian Kilmeade	Elizabeth Warren wants to take it down.
0826	Brian Kilmeade	Who do you think right now is likely to be your opponent?
0827	Brian Kilmeade	Mayor Pete is evidently moving up in the early states.
0828	Brian Kilmeade	Joe Biden wins most national polls.
0829	Brian Kilmeade	Elizabeth Warren is still among the leaders.
0830	Brian Kilmeade	Who do you think it's going to be?
0831	Donald Trump	Well, I don't know if Joe can make it.
0832	Donald Trump	Mentally, he's off.
0833	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
0834	Donald Trump	So I don't know if he's going to make it mentally.
0835	Donald Trump	If he can get through it, you know, without cracking up, which is a real question.
0836	Donald Trump	I mean, many people asked that.
0837	Donald Trump	Maybe him.
0838	Donald Trump	You know, don't forget, people have seen his name for a long time.
0839	Donald Trump	But Pete is you know, I call him Alfred E. Neuman, to me, reminds me of Mad magazine, Alfred E. Neuman.
0840	Donald Trump	And I don't see him.
0841	Donald Trump	I don't see him dealing with President Xi.
0842	Donald Trump	I don't see him dealing with Kim Jong Un.
0843	Donald Trump	I just don't see it.
0844	Donald Trump	But maybe he is.
0845	Donald Trump	I mean, look, I wouldn't mind running against any of them.
0846	Donald Trump	So I would say maybe Biden has the advantage.
0847	Donald Trump	I think Pocahontas has come up from the embers.
0848	Donald Trump	I thought I, I mean, I hit her too early.
0849	Donald Trump	I came up with this name that seems to have stuck very nicely..
0850	Brian Kilmeade	Bloomberg?
0851	Donald Trump	But they don't use it.
0852	Donald Trump	I don't see him.
0853	Donald Trump	I know him pretty well.
0854	Donald Trump	He finished very weak in New York.
0855	Donald Trump	He starts with, you know, telling you what you can drink, what you can do, what you -- no, I don't see it.
0856	Donald Trump	He's desperately -- I'm sure he's going to run.
0857	Donald Trump	He is going to spend.
0858	Donald Trump	He's got the money just to put on a great campaign.
0859	Donald Trump	I don't see it.
0860	Donald Trump	His time has come and gone.
0861	Steve Doocy	It would be hard to believe a New York real estate developer, or a billionaire could ever be president.
0862	Steve Doocy	Mr. President.
0863	Steve Doocy	Just kidding.
0864	Steve Doocy	You know, the stock market hit another record this past week.
0865	Steve Doocy	Clearly, that is your strong suit going into the 2020, because, you know, you look at the polls.
0866	Steve Doocy	People feel better about their money situation right now.
0867	Donald Trump	Right.
0868	Steve Doocy	Going forward toward November of next year, how are you going to make sure everybody understands what you have been able to do over the last, then, four years?
0869	Donald Trump	By talking to you, it's all good to do.
0870	Steve Doocy	Good.
0871	Donald Trump	Everyone's listening right down.
0872	Donald Trump	Nobody's listening to any other show.
0873	Donald Trump	But look, strong suit.
0874	Donald Trump	My strong suit is I rebuilt a military.
0875	Donald Trump	The vets -- for years, you would turn on your television.
0876	Donald Trump	Every night, you'd see a story about the vets and how badly they're being treated, and it's a horror show.
0877	Donald Trump	You don't hear that anymore.
0878	Donald Trump	I got veterans choice.
0879	Donald Trump	I got to -- that means they can go see a doctor if they have to wait online.
0880	Donald Trump	If they go see a doctor, we pay the bill.
0881	Donald Trump	It's unbelievable what happened.
0882	Donald Trump	I have veterans accountability.
0883	Donald Trump	You couldn't fire -- for 50 years, they've been trying to get -- you couldn't fire because there were unions and civil service.
0884	Donald Trump	So if you had somebody beating up vets, stealing from the V.A., you couldn't fire them for any reason for it.
0885	Brian Kilmeade	Certainly something to run on.
0886	Brian Kilmeade	And they are appreciative it.
0887	Brian Kilmeade	On the economy --
0888	Donald Trump	I got that --
0889	Brian Kilmeade	President Xi --
0890	Donald Trump	But listen.
0891	Donald Trump	Rebuilding the military.
0892	Donald Trump	All of the things I've done.
0893	Donald Trump	Plus, we've had peace.
0894	Donald Trump	You know, we're pulling way down in Afghanistan.
0895	Donald Trump	We're working on an agreement now with the Taliban.
0896	Donald Trump	Let's see what happens.
0897	Donald Trump	The last time I was close to have an agreement, then they thought when they came over, they thought it would be good to kill people so they could, you know, negotiate from a position of strength.
0898	Donald Trump	They killed 12 people in order to show they are tough guys, and I canceled the meeting.
0899	Donald Trump	I said, "That's not what we're dealing with."
0900	Donald Trump	Anyway.
0901	Donald Trump	We're pulling back.
0902	Donald Trump	I just pulled out of Syria; except I kept the oil.
0903	Donald Trump	If it was okay with you.
0904	Brian Kilmeade	We 600 hundred guys there.
0905	Brian Kilmeade	Right?
0906	Donald Trump	I want to -- okay.
0907	Brian Kilmeade	President Xi has just said this.
0908	Brian Kilmeade	We want to work for a Phase 1 agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality with the United States.
0909	Brian Kilmeade	Where are you at?
0910	Brian Kilmeade	You were kind of down on a deal and the market kind of dipped on this.
0911	Brian Kilmeade	Where do you stand right now with the trade deal with China?
0912	Donald Trump	Very good.
0913	Donald Trump	We have a deal, potentially, very close.
0914	Donald Trump	He wants to make it much more than I want to make it.
0915	Donald Trump	I'm not anxious to make it.
0916	Donald Trump	We're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
0917	Donald Trump	We never took in 10 cents.
0918	Donald Trump	We are not paying like, you know, they fed the line, you know -- the media fed the line about us paying.
0919	Donald Trump	Now, normally you would pay for tariffs --
0920	Brian Kilmeade	But he literally just said, Mr. President, he's -- "we want to do a deal."
0921	Brian Kilmeade	I very rarely see that.
0922	Brian Kilmeade	We want to work out a Phase 1 agreement.
0923	Donald Trump	The problem is -- I didn't like his word "equality" because we started off so low.
0924	Donald Trump	We've lost 500 billion dollars a year for many, many years.
0925	Donald Trump	We've rebuilt China, and I give him a lot of credit.
0926	Donald Trump	The ones that don't give credit are our past presidents, and especially the last one with his crummy vice president.
0927	Donald Trump	China took us to the cleaners.
0928	Donald Trump	He didn't even know that.
0929	Donald Trump	Biden in the first debate said, "Oh, these are wonderful people."
0930	Donald Trump	Sure, they're wonderful people.
0931	Donald Trump	We've given them 500 billion a year.
0932	Donald Trump	Five hundred billion.
0933	Donald Trump	That's not including theft of intellectual property, et cetera.
0934	Donald Trump	So I told President Xi, this can't be like an even deal because we're starting off from the floor and you're already at the ceiling.
0935	Ainsley Earhardt	Not to mention --
0936	Donald Trump	So we have to have a much better deal.
0937	Donald Trump	The bottom line is we have a very good chance to make a deal.
0938	Brian Kilmeade	We do.
0939	Ainsley Earhardt	And not to mention happening to Hong Kong with these --
0940	Steve Doocy	Right.
0941	Ainsley Earhardt	-- pro democracy.
0942	Donald Trump	Well, that's a complicating factor.
0943	Donald Trump	There's no question about it.
0944	Donald Trump	And if it weren't for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes.
0945	Donald Trump	He's got a million soldiers standing outside of Hong Kong that aren't going in only because I ask him, "Please don't do that.
0946	Donald Trump	You'll be making a big mistake.
0947	Donald Trump	It's going to have a tremendous negative impact on the trade deal."
0948	Donald Trump	And he wants to make a trade.
0949	Donald Trump	Brian, one thing, before I get off, I just want to say one thing.
0950	Brian Kilmeade	Okay.
0951	Donald Trump	We have the strongest economy in the history of our country.
0952	Donald Trump	We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had.
0953	Donald Trump	African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American, the best in history.
0954	Donald Trump	We have the best unemployment and employment numbers.
0955	Donald Trump	More people working today than ever before.
0956	Donald Trump	But listen to this.
0957	Donald Trump	We have now the greatest economy that we've ever had.
0958	Donald Trump	We've increased by 20 trillion dollars.
0959	Donald Trump	China's gone down probably by 30 or 35 trillion dollars.
0960	Donald Trump	If crooked Hillary had won, China would now be the largest economy in the world.
0961	Donald Trump	They were going to surpass us, expected to, in the second year of the presidency.
0962	Donald Trump	Right now --
0963	Brian Kilmeade	[Inaudible]
0964	Donald Trump	They'll never catch up.
0965	Brian Kilmeade	But the farmers were hoping for that huge purchase.
0966	Brian Kilmeade	And it looks like they want to do a deal --
0967	Donald Trump	But, Brian, they have it.
0968	Donald Trump	Wait, wait, wait.
0969	Donald Trump	Just one thing.
0970	Donald Trump	So they have it because I said, "How much have the farmers lost because of China targeting them?"
0971	Donald Trump	Sir?
972	Donald Trump	Sixteen million dollars and 12 billion in the previous year, I gave them 12 billion dollars out of the tariffs, had tens of billions left over.
0973	Donald Trump	And I gave them 16 billion out of the tariffs, and had tens of billions left over.
0974	Donald Trump	Goes into the Treasury.
0975	Donald Trump	Brian, our farmers are doing great, right?
0976	Donald Trump	And now we just signed a deal with Japan, 40 billion dollars.
0977	Donald Trump	They're buying from the farmers.
0978	Donald Trump	We just signed a deal with South Korea.
0979	Donald Trump	A tremendous deal.
0980	Donald Trump	We're making tremendous deals.
0981	Donald Trump	But you have to understand, these deals with China, they've been taking advantage of us for 25 years.
0982	Donald Trump	It's hard for them to understand it's not going to happen anymore.
0983	Donald Trump	And now they understand.
0984	Brian Kilmeade	They are calling on you to veto legislation.
0985	Brian Kilmeade	They are calling on you to veto legislation coming out of the Senate that supports the Hong Kong students.
0986	Brian Kilmeade	What are you going to do?
0987	Donald Trump	Well, I'll tell you.
0988	Donald Trump	Look, we have to stand with Hong Kong.
0989	Donald Trump	But I'm also standing with President Xi.
0990	Donald Trump	He's a friend of mine.
0991	Donald Trump	He's an incredible guy.
0992	Donald Trump	We have to stand.
0993	Donald Trump	But I'd like to see them work it out.
0994	Donald Trump	Okay.
0995	Donald Trump	We have to see and work it out.
0996	Donald Trump	But I stand with Hong Kong.
0997	Donald Trump	I stand with freedom.
0998	Donald Trump	I stand with all of the things that we want to do.
0999	Donald Trump	But we also are in the process of making the largest trade deal in history.
1000	Donald Trump	And if we could do that, that would be great.
1001	Donald Trump	China wants it.
1002	Donald Trump	We want it.
1003	Donald Trump	And I will say this.
1004	Donald Trump	If it weren't for me, thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong right now.
1005	Donald Trump	And you wouldn't have any riots.
1006	Donald Trump	You'd have a police state, but thousands of people.
1007	Donald Trump	The only reason he's not going in is because I'm saying, "It's going to affect our trade deal, you don't want to do that."
1008	Donald Trump	I speak to him.
1009	Ainsley Earhardt	Sir, you're running in 2020.
1010	Ainsley Earhardt	And many people are -- we all just assumed your vice-presidential nominee would be Mike Pence.
1011	Ainsley Earhardt	But then we're reading headlines about Kellyanne Conway's husband saying that Nikki Haley is fighting for that position.
1012	Ainsley Earhardt	I'm a South Carolinian originally from South Carolina.
1013	Ainsley Earhardt	Nikki Haley was our governor.
1014	Ainsley Earhardt	And I know she really did a good job as an ambassador.
1015	Ainsley Earhardt	So who is going to be your running mate in 2020?
1016	Donald Trump	No, she's great.
1017	Donald Trump	Well, first of all, Kellyanne is great, but she's married to a total whack job.
1018	Donald Trump	I think she must have done some number on him, Ainsley.
1019	Donald Trump	I don't know what Kellyanne did to that guy, but she -- because I don't even know him.
1020	Donald Trump	I mean, I've met him for seconds.
1021	Donald Trump	He's got to be some kind of a nut job.
1022	Donald Trump	She must have done some bad things to him because that guy is crazy.
1023	Donald Trump	But you know what?
1024	Donald Trump	Mike Pence is a great vice president.
1025	Donald Trump	He's our man, 100 percent.
1026	Donald Trump	Nikki will absolutely be involved.
1027	Donald Trump	She's a friend of mine.
1028	Donald Trump	She endorsed me with the most beautiful endorsement you've ever heard.
1029	Donald Trump	She did a great job at the U.N.. She's now in the private sector.
1030	Donald Trump	I assume she's doing very well.
1031	Donald Trump	But, Nikki will be back in some form because she's great, and just she's my friend.
1032	Donald Trump	But no, Mike Pence, I know, I've seen this rumor.
1033	Donald Trump	It keeps, you know, popping up.
1034	Donald Trump	And Nikki would be great.
1035	Donald Trump	But Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as Vice President.
1036	Donald Trump	He's our guy.
1037	Donald Trump	He's my friend.
1038	Donald Trump	And look, we have a great team.
1039	Donald Trump	This has been a very strong team.
1040	Brian Kilmeade	Mike Pompeo going to the Senate.
1041	Brian Kilmeade	Are you going to push him to do that?
1042	Donald Trump	So Mike has done an incredible job.
1043	Donald Trump	You know, I have an incredible cabinet.
1044	Donald Trump	We don't get enough credit.
1045	Donald Trump	We have incredible.
1046	Donald Trump	Mike graduated number one at Harvard Law.
1047	Donald Trump	Number one at West Point, is an incredible guy, doing a great job in a very complicated world, doing a great job as secretary of state.
1048	Donald Trump	Remember, they all said, Brian, I'd be in World War III my first day.
1049	Donald Trump	And now they're saying, "Well, he's much more moderate."
1050	Donald Trump	Well, actually, I rebuilt the military to a level that nobody is going to play games with us.
1051	Donald Trump	But if we don't have to use it, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
1052	Donald Trump	So Mike would win easily in Kansas.
1053	Donald Trump	Great state.
1054	Donald Trump	And it's a Trump state.
1055	Donald Trump	He'd win easily.
1056	Donald Trump	And if I thought they had somebody out there that couldn't win, and Mike would really -- he loves what he's doing.
1057	Donald Trump	But if I thought they had somebody out there that -- and he came to me and said, "Look, I'd rather stay where I am," but he loves Kansas.
1058	Donald Trump	He loves the people of Kansas.
1059	Donald Trump	If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that, and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas.
1060	Steve Doocy	Well, I am from Kansas, and you're right.
1061	Steve Doocy	It is a great state.
1062	Steve Doocy	I'm Mr. President.
1063	Steve Doocy	A moment ago, you were talking about rumors.
1064	Steve Doocy	I'm sure you saw there was a rumor that, you know, you went to the hospital last week.
1065	Steve Doocy	It wasn't in the schedule.
1066	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1067	Steve Doocy	And obviously something is really the matter with you.
1068	Steve Doocy	So can you tell us what's the matter with you?
1069	Donald Trump	Okay.
1070	Donald Trump	Yeah.
1071	Donald Trump	A lot of things are a matter with me.
1072	Donald Trump	I mean, number one, what did they do this for?
1073	Donald Trump	But I love it.
1074	Donald Trump	You know, one of those things.
1075	Donald Trump	So we had some free time.
1076	Donald Trump	My doctor calls.
1077	Donald Trump	He said, "Would you like to do some work?"
1078	Donald Trump	Because I'm going to be slightly busy in 2020, in January and February, especially if Crazy Nancy does something that nobody ever would even think of doing.
1079	Donald Trump	So I'll be busy interviewing Biden, interviewing, watching the interviews of shifty Schiff, and why he made up all of this stuff, and why he made up my statements.
1080	Donald Trump	So the doctor called, "Sir, would you like to go out" -- because they had three hours -- "Would you like to go out to Walter Reed and do your first part of the physical right?"
1081	Donald Trump	I said, "Yeah, go ahead.
1082	Donald Trump	Let's go."
1083	Donald Trump	So we go out.
1084	Donald Trump	I go there.
1085	Donald Trump	I meet with parents.
1086	Donald Trump	One in particular, I meet with the wife and family of a young soldier who is being operated on and lost his arm and lost a leg.
1087	Donald Trump	Horrible thing.
1088	Donald Trump	And I spent time with them.
1089	Donald Trump	Anyway, I do a very routine part of the physical.
1090	Donald Trump	Get in the car, come back.
1091	Donald Trump	On the way back, I'm hearing that I'm in the hospital.
1092	Donald Trump	And by the way, it just so you know, like literally many, many, many cars go, it's not like -- and they have a press van following -- you know when I go, I'd love to be able to go like the old days, when I get in a car and close the doors, lock them up, and drive.
1093	Donald Trump	Right?
1094	Donald Trump	That doesn't happen anymore.
1095	Donald Trump	It's a little different.
1096	Donald Trump	But we have a press van.
1097	Donald Trump	You know how that works.
1098	Donald Trump	And so, we drive out to Walter Reed, greatest doctors, greatest everything, greatest place you've ever seen, what they can do.
1099	Donald Trump	So I start my physical, go see the soldier, go see the families, did a little tour of the building, then get back in.
1100	Donald Trump	On the way back, I'm hearing rumors that I'm in the hospital.
1101	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I had chest pains.
1102	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I had a massive heart attack.
1103	Donald Trump	Then I'm hearing rumors that I'm not coming back.
1104	Donald Trump	I'm staying at Walter Reed overnight and maybe for a long time.
1105	Donald Trump	And I say -- I come home and my wife says, "Darling, darling, are you okay?"
1106	Donald Trump	I said, "Okay from what?".
1107	Donald Trump	[Laughter] They say, they have it down.
1108	Donald Trump	CNN, mostly CNN, but that stupid MSNBC, which is just as bad.
1109	Donald Trump	Can you imagine?
1110	Donald Trump	I made them so much money on The Apprentice and that's the way -- but anyway those two.
1111	Donald Trump	And so, they started a false narrative.
1112	Steve Doocy	All right.
1113	Donald Trump	And it was this.
1114	Donald Trump	So the doctor gets on.
1115	Donald Trump	He said, "No, no."
1116	Donald Trump	It didn't matter.
1117	Donald Trump	No matter what we told them, they were going with it.
1118	Brian Kilmeade	So your health -- Mr. President, your health is fine.
1119	Donald Trump	Well, let me tell you this.
1120	Donald Trump	I just got back from Austin, Texas, where I was with Tim Cook.
1121	Donald Trump	He's going to be building a one-billion-dollar facility to make whatever he makes.
1122	Donald Trump	You know, that's Apple.
1123	Donald Trump	And he's going to build this incredible facility.
1124	Donald Trump	We toured another facility where they make the Mac Pro, which is phenomenal, which was opening.
1125	Donald Trump	The reason we've opened that day job, they're making all of the Mac Pros all over the world.
1126	Donald Trump	They're making them right in Austin, Texas.
1127	Donald Trump	I spent -- I left early.
1128	Donald Trump	I got home very late.
1129	Donald Trump	And I did many things in between.
1130	Donald Trump	And I was sort of joking to some of the people.
1131	Donald Trump	I said, "Hey, that's not bad considering these people had me all wash up and finished in a hospital that I just get back from a 14-hour day.
1132	Donald Trump	.
1133	Steve Doocy	Yup.
1134	Donald Trump	No.
1135	Donald Trump	It's a disgrace.
1136	Donald Trump	Let me just say what it really is.
1137	Donald Trump	It's fake, disgusting news.
1138	Donald Trump	I'll let you know -- you know what?
1139	Donald Trump	Nothing wrong if you're not feeling well.
1140	Donald Trump	I have --
1141	Steve Doocy	Right.
1142	Steve Doocy	But it wasn't on your schedule, and so people thought, Oh, there must be something.
1143	Steve Doocy	.
1144	Donald Trump	No, because the doctor said, Sir."
1145	Donald Trump	You know, I'm not blaming that.
1146	Brian Kilmeade	Get a phase done.
1147	Donald Trump	You might be able to knock off half of your physical.
1148	Donald Trump	I said, "You know what?
1149	Donald Trump	That's not a bad idea" because I had three hours.
1150	Brian Kilmeade	So, Mr. President --
1151	Donald Trump	Between that and watching a football game that I didn't want to watch.
1152	Donald Trump	What do we -- I had three free hours.
1153	Steve Doocy	All right.
1154	Donald Trump	And he said, "Would you like to do it?"
1155	Donald Trump	So here's the thing.
1156	Donald Trump	It's so disgusting what they do because they knew it wasn't true.
1157	Donald Trump	They went with it.
1158	Donald Trump	After we certified with medical people, we had three medical people call them up to say it's not true.
1159	Donald Trump	They went with it anyway.
1160	Donald Trump	You couldn't kill the story because they're bad people.
1161	Donald Trump	It's fake, corrupt news.
1162	Donald Trump	It's CNN mostly -- Well, Mr. President --
1163	Donald Trump	It --
1164	Brian Kilmeade	I think it does good for your health.
1165	Brian Kilmeade	I'm not a doctor, but if I was to write a prescription, calling in every week to update the country about what's happening might be good for your health.
1166	Brian Kilmeade	That's something to consider.
1167	Brian Kilmeade	You have the phone number.
1168	Donald Trump	Well, you know that I've been doing it for years.
1169	Brian Kilmeade	You have been.
1170	Donald Trump	With your group, I've been doing it years.
1171	Brian Kilmeade	For stress relief.
1172	Donald Trump	It was up to me -- and it is up to me, and we'll do it more often.
1173	Donald Trump	But I have a lot of fun doing it.
1174	Donald Trump	And you know what's the best part?
1175	Donald Trump	We get the true word out.
1176	Donald Trump	And here's a true word.
1177	Donald Trump	Our country is doing great.
1178	Donald Trump	We're respected again.
1179	Donald Trump	Our military is strong.
1180	Donald Trump	We have the number one economy in the world by far.
1181	Donald Trump	And China's never going to catch us as long as we have a smart person where I am.
1182	Donald Trump	They'll never catch us.
1183	Donald Trump	They've had the worst year they've had in 57 years, and we've had the best year we've ever had by far.
1184	Donald Trump	So it's good.
1185	Donald Trump	I get the word out on your show.
1186	Donald Trump	I love your show.
1187	Ainsley Earhardt	Thank you so much, Mr. President, for being with us.
1188	Steve Doocy	Yup.
1189	Brian Kilmeade	President Trump --
1190	Donald Trump	Thanks so much.
1191	Brian Kilmeade	-- thanks so much.
1192	Brian Kilmeade	Thank you.
1193	Brian Kilmeade	All right.
1194	Steve Doocy	All right.
1195	Donald Trump	Goodbye.
